Cerise was still thinking, but not in any way that truly mattered. She became aware that she was being surrounded by the notion of emptiness, but still felt completely at home. There was a physicality and a familiarity to her location that she couldn’t quite place, but knew that it was somewhere that she felt safe. The void around her began to swim and dissipate and she found herself lamenting its passing; if she wasn’t anywhere, then nothing could get through to her. That security, that blissful ignorance, was gone.

As the world solidified, Cerise became aware that her head was pressed up against something hard and unforgiving, her neck bent at an uncomfortable angle. Blinking through the blur that threatened to overcome her vision, she found herself with a geometric view of the room that she’d just left, a strange force holding her in the upper corner. Everything was exactly as she remembered. Both herself and The Spiraliser were noticeably absent, but the chair still sat in the centre of the room, primed for a user and looking strangely forlorn.

Held in place as she was, Cerise felt the walls begin to move inwards. She started to feel a pressure from all sides as each and every surface started to press together. Her neck started to take the full effect of the force and she could feel the muscles straining. Flailing wildly, she pushed her arms and legs off every surface that she could find.

Cerise managed to push off the ceiling with enough force to move laterally, taking the weight off her neck and putting the light fixture on the ceiling directly in her line of sight. Rotating herself again so that she was looking down into the room, Cerise tensed her legs and kicked off the wall.

The walls continued to close in around her as she flew across the room, trying to work out where to head next. Cerise noticed that all of the planks covering the windows had disappeared, so she twisted herself so that she began to drift towards them. Feeling strangely confident in her ability to manoeuvre weightlessly, Cerise began a confident breaststroke towards the windows.

As she drew closer to escape, the proximity of the walls started to feel more and more invasive, broadening the distance that she still had to travel. For every stroke that she made, the walls would drew a foot closer. Finally, they began cutting off her air and her breaststroke turned into an desperate doggy paddle. As she felt the press of the walls against her body, Cerise reached out blindly, scrabbling for the windowsill. Finding something solid finally within her grip, she grabbed hold and pulled.

With the desperation of her thrust for freedom, Cerise propelled over the fire escape attached to the window and found herself falling, gravity suddenly kicking in, face-first towards the tarmac of the adjoining alleyway. She clutched frantically at passing outcrops and balconies as she passed, but they all slipped through her fingers. Resigning herself to her fate, Cerise clenched her eyes shut and turned her face away from the ground.

After a few seconds of not feeling an impact, Cerise opened her eyes and found herself walking down the very alley that she’d just been falling into. From this perspective, she was able to recognise exactly where she was: she had just turned down the side street besides the McDonald’s, heading home after a long shift at work. Cerise fought against the external force that appeared to be pushing her down this path, but found herself entirely unable to deviate; her fate on this path had already been sealed.

Cerise was walking past an overflowing dumpster when she heard brisk footsteps coming up behind her; everything about this situation was straight out of a classic horror film and she hated it. As Cerise slowly picked up the pace, attempting to exude an aura of cool disinterest, she heard the sounds disappear behind her and started to relax. Suddenly, she felt a sharp, tight grip on her wrist and Cerise whipped around to face her attacker.

Instead of the villain that she’d expected, Cerise found herself looking into the eyes of a clearly stricken young woman. The woman tightened her grip on Cerise’s wrist, looked deeply into her eyes and began to whisper frantically.

“You’ve got to get out of here,” she gushed. “He’s coming to find you. He told me. He’s here somewhere and you’ve got to get out of here before he comes and takes you away too.”

Cerise tried to respond, but found her mouth too dry.

“Look. Take this number,” the woman continued, shoving a piece of paper into Cerise’s hand. “Call us if you hear anything and we’ll come and help you.” Glacing nervously around her, the woman turned and briskly walked away.

“Never again,” the woman mumbled. “He’ll never do this again.”

The scene dissolved around Cerise, windows and dumpsters melting away to form the void in which she’d become so comfortable. Cerise found herself still clutching the business card, but, as she brought it closer to her face, found it illegible. Dropping the card to the floor, Cerise began to walk mindlessly, unable to lock down exactly what she was meant to be doing next. Far off in the distance, she saw some form of surface and started to head towards that.

As she drew closer, Cerise saw that the tabletop was covered in pineapples of all shapes and sizes, in all stages of preparation. Her mouth began to water. Breaking into a run, she reached the table and began frantically clutching at everything within reach, shoving it into her mouth, eating both rind and flesh alike. The juice filled her mouth, making her realise how long it had been since she’d had any form of food or drink; she savoured each and every mouthful before quickly forcing even more into her mouth.

Hours passed and Cerise collapsed to the floor, exhausted. Tiredness swept over her and she scrunched her eyes shut and leaned forwards, suddenly sobbing, pounding the floor, as the weight of everything that she’d been through overwhelmed her. She was trapped; she was lost. When she finally opened her eyes, Cerise saw a splattering of red covering the ground in front of her. A new wave of panic engulfed her as she brought her hand to her mouth, suddenly aware that it was dripping wet; her hand came away red.

Blood dripped painlessly but profusely, even when Cerise tried to block its flow with her hands. It dripped through her fingers unimpeded and continued to splatter on the floor, creating a disturbing Jackson Pollock. Cerise pushed herself to her feet with one hand and, keeping one fruitlessly held to her mouth, she began to run. All she could knew what to do was run.

As she ran, her surroundings coalesced and Cerise found all of the terror, all sense of danger, drain out of her and she slowed to a walk. The blend of the void again became the entrance to the alleyway that she’d unwillingly become so familiar with. Her feet on the cobblestones echoed around the street, announcing her arrival, her availability. As Cerise passed the overflowing dumpster, the footsteps again began to approach behind her.

Behind her, a loud clanging of metal and rumpled cloth made her jump into the air. Cerise picked up the pace, trying to distance herself from the noise, but, again, found a large, firm grip on her wrist that caused her to whip around. This time, the claw that clutched her arm was indeed that: enormous and scaled, talons in place of fingers. Cerise tried to scream for help, but couldn’t force a noise to escape from her lips; she made the motions, but no sound came out.

This creature was clearly humanoid in shape, but hadn’t had any direct relation to the form for quite some time. It was dressed in flowing green robes with countless medallions and chains draped around its neck. Its face had warped and been elongated to form a large snout, with extended, but still clearly human, teeth poking out at all angles. What it had gained in bulk when it transformed didn’t transfer over to its height and it glared up at her, a wicked smile starting to appear. Every motion caused the scales that covered its body to audibly crack with the force of the action.

“You’ll do,” it slurred, scales popping around its mouth. “You’ll be a perfect last one.” Moving faster than she could react, it jerked an arm forward and plunged a syringe into her upturned arm. As Cerise collapsed to the floor, falling unconscious, she heard the sinister voice of the creature bellow out: “NEVER AGAIN”. The ground gave out from under her and she felt air rushing past her, the blackness of her surroundings imposing and crushing her until, finally, she lost consciousness.

Light streamed across Cerise’s face, forcing her to squint as she tried to open her eyes. She was lying on her side, limbs stiff from sleeping on such a hard surface. Her eyelids felt heavy and, as she pushed her body up off the floor and began rubbing her eyes, she struggled to recognise where she was.

As she caught a glimpse of the clumps of severed rope all around her, all of the memories of being here, along with all of the memories of wherever she had just been, came rushing back to her. Letting out an involuntary yelp, Cerise pushed herself away from the chair and backed up against the nearest wall, eyes darting around to find The Spiraliser.

She saw the message on the wall before she saw him sprawled beneath it. On the wall opposite her, drawn in red paint, was the phrase that she’d recently heard echoed so frequently: “NEVER AGAIN”. Her curiosity overcoming her sense of terror, Cerise used the wall as a support to get to her feet and apprehensively began to shuffle towards the recognisably blue bulk. The Spiraliser was splayed on his back, left arm bent awkwardly, looking up at her with a tell-tale vacant expression.

The yellow cape had been removed from his back and haphazardly draped over him. His characteristic blue costume was dotted with red stains, clearly originating from multiple wounds. Cerise knelt beside him and gently shook him, immediately recoiling as she did so. She waited a few seconds before trying again, harder this time. Leaning back to sit on her feet, Cerise looked up again at the words sprawled on the wall and found comfort in it; there was something to be said about the certainty of knowing she’d never have to relive this.

Returning her gaze to the man in front of her, Cerise suddenly noticed his unrelenting stare and, leaning forward, closed his eyelids. Getting again to her feet, she turned and started idly rubbing her left wrist before wincing at the contact. Cerise tentatively looked down and saw that her left arm looked as though it had been scorched; red inflamed skin reached from her wrist halfway up to her elbow. It looked as though it had been viciously and repeatedly twisted. Her head clearing, Cerise realised that she needed to get this looked at as soon as possible.

This was when she noticed the sheer amount of light streaming into the room. One of the windows that had been boarded up last she looked, now sat exposed, the planks lying split and scattered all over the floor below it. Someone had either taken an axe to it or possessed a inordinate amount of lower-body strength.

With an uncharacteristic confidence, Cerise strode over to the window and began to climb out onto the fire escape. Taking one last look behind her at the man that had, willingly or not, irrevocably changed her life, Cerise felt a strange sadness overcome her. She couldn’t help but observe that, whoever he was, it was clear that he bled and died like anybody else.
