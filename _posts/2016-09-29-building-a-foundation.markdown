“Hey. You alright?” James asked from the head of the bed, leaning over the edge to pick his shirt up from the floor. He was still under the duvet and it bunched around him as he reached. Managing to just about grasp it between two fingers, he pulled it closer to the bed and pulled it on.

“Yeah. Why?” Chris mumbled. He was sat at the very end of the bed, fully clothed, staring blankly down at the floor. His face was vacant, but his eyes were darting frantically from side to side.

“I dunno. You’re just being a bit strange.”

James pushed the duvet off him and revealed his bare legs. Swinging them over the side of the mattress, he sat up. As he picked up his jeans from the floor, he paused, struck by a thought.

“Was that OK?”

“Yeah,” said Chris, turning towards him to show off a flash of a smile. Just as quickly as the happiness had resurfaced, it was immediately gone. The eye contact, however lingered. “Fine.”

“Okay.”

James returned the smile, as wan as Chris’s was brief. That appeared to placate him and he turned back to his silent reverie.

“Okay,” Chris nodded. The two of them sat there in silence for a moment. Taking a deep breath and giving it time to fully exhale, James continued on undeterred; he knew what he’d been getting into.

“Are you free tomorrow?” James inquired, getting up to hunt for his shoes. He spotted one instantly underneath the small desk by the bed and walked over to pick it up. He began looking around for the other.

“Chris?” he prompted.

“Yeah, probably,” Chris murmured. James began to turn towards him, face brightening, before catching himself. He turned away before Chris glanced up and caught him. He spotted his other shoe by the door and strolled over to it.

“Do you wanna do something?” James asked with all of the nonchalance he could muster. He bent over to pick up the shoe and pulled them tightly to his chest. Unable to resist, he turned around to face Chris.

“Yeah, OK,” Chris answered. He turned to face James with something that might have been a smile before he answered. “I’ll message you.”

“Alright, cool.” James nodded, beginning to grin. He walked towards the door, clutching his shoes in his hands. He shifted them both to one hand and turned the door handle. As he pulled the door open, he turned to see Chris still sat resolutely still on the bed.

“I’ll speak to you later,” James whispered.

“Yeah, OK,” came the answer from the bed. Sighing yet again, James turned and left the room, letting the door close softly behind him.
