No matter who you are, there's that thing that, as soon you see it, your stomach drops.

It might not even have seemed to be a big deal; you've been worrying about it for weeks. Suddenly it all solidifies and becomes real in a way that you hadn't imagine. “Everything will be alright,” you tell yourself. “This too shall pass.” Everyone that you speak to and try to relate you says to you that they might be able to help or that all you need to do is buckle in and ride it out. For a second you believe them.

However, you can't get rid of that nagging feeling at the back of your mind that tells you that everything might not be OK.

Growing up, everything seemed black and white: you work hard and you earn a living. You meet someone; you fall in love. Then life comes around and hits you straight in the face with its absurd reality. Those commitments that you made don't seem so possible anymore. You find yourself worry about all of the time, money and opportunity slipping by and how, no matter how much you try to clutch at it, it slips past you. Nothing is a given and you need to fight to get anything significant done.

Then, one day, it wasn't as difficult. Everything seems possible again and you can start to feel yourself making it through without a struggle. Maybe you aren't such a failure after all. Everything that you learned does work; it's all about the approach and the application. But then you slip up again. Sliding back down the rabbit hole, you hit yourself on the bookcase; that piano clips you as it falls past. Landing back in Wonderland, you look around and find yourself wondering if there's ever going to be a chance to get out again.

But then you take a step. Then another and another. Keep pushing through and you're getting somewhere. Ignore the Mad Hatter; nobody cares about your riddles or your nonsense. We've got things to do. Another step. Just one more. A barrage of information and nonsense from all sides and you find yourself starting to get overwhelmed. Then you get a glimpse of that garden through the doorway and you know that there's something worth pushed ahead for. There's always something pushing ahead for; all you have to do is find it.

It might take you a while, but you'll eventually find your way out of that hole. It might be late and you might be weary. You'll dust yourself off and just keep moving forwards. At the end of the day, that's all we all need to do. You can look back and remember where you've been, as everybody does, but as long as you keep looking forward then everything will be alright. I promise.
