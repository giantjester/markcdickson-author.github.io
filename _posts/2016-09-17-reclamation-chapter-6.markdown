Dani stood there for a moment, allowing the fear to spread throughout the entirety of her body, letting it overtake all of her natural instincts and infect the deepest parts of her consciousness.

The God of Gods towering above her was, she decided, extraordinarily aptly named. He exuded both an arrogance and an ability to back his threats up that, combined with the fact that she’d been using him as nothing more than a teleportation disc for the past few hours, made him a, to put it lightly, discernible threat.

As the crushing sense of fear and self-doubt cycled back around to her brain, she cut it off. It had had its moment; now it was her turn.

“Split up,” Dani screamed, releasing her grasp on her family members. “Get somewhere and stay there.” She heard a booming laugh come from up in the sky.

“Oh Dani, Dani, Dani,” it soothed. “Do you really think that there’s anywhere you can go where I can’t follow? The only reason that you still exist now is at my will to see you suffer. You deserve this; you’ve earned this.”

Dani threw herself behind a large willow tree and backed up hard against it, scraping her back through her clothes. She could still feel the presence of Zeus behind her, glaring at her, even though she could no longer see him.

“Hmmmm,” Zeus continued, unperturbed. “Where am I to look? How am I do get to this person trapped behind this enormous rock?” Dani peeked around the tree and saw a hand reach down from above and grasp the carved stone statue.

“And who do we have behind statue number one?” Zeus asked. The statue was quickly and effortlessly ripped from the ground, revealing her husband, the one whom she’d been pining after for years, the one from who she’d had the most time stolen.

“Well, well, well,” Zeus boomed. “The man whom my precious Dani deems more suitable for parenthood than myself. You must be quite the man.” The hand reached down and wrapped around him, closing firmly even as Dec continued to struggle free.

“Dani, oh, my Dani,” Zeus called. “Look what I have here. Your one true love.” There was a brief pause. “And what am I to do with him?” Dani saw the fingers relax, leaving Dec laid flat on the palm of the godly hand. A second hand descended from above and grabbed one of Dec’s arms, lifting him off the palm and leaving him dangling. The now free hand grabbed the other arm and lifted Dec into the air. He dangled there, face grimacing from the weight placed on his shoulders, until Zeus began to shuffle his hands from side to side, tweaking the human puppet strings.

“Oh, look at me,” the disembodied voice thundered down. “I’m such a perfect man; I’m even more almighty than Zeus himself. It’s such a shame than I’m as dumb as a box of rocks. If only I were smarter, I wouldn’t have hidden behind something so obvious and so stupid.” Dec began to scream in pain as he was jostled roughly around, stopping only in the moments between sentences when Zeus’s puppetry would halt.

“Oh well,” Zeus concluded, releasing one arm. “It doesn't matter now.”

Zeus launched Dec into the air; he was there one moment and gone the next. Dani leaned back around the tree and pressed up against it, tears flowing freely down her face. The sound of his screams disappeared as he ascended and she continued to sob silently. The desperate cries for help began to reach her ears again. Dani wishing desperately for them to stop, her heart breaking when they did.

“Nooooo!” came a cry to Dani’s left. Dani turned her head and, through the blur of her tears, saw her child, the almighty warrior, charging forwards from their hiding place, stopping to square their shoulders before speaking.

“You shall not kill my father and get away with it,” the brave warrior cried. “I killed my own grandfather, so I have no qualms about killing you.” At this, Dani pushed off from the tree and spread her arms opened wide.

“Wait, no, please don’t” she wailed. “Take me instead.” Dani saw the towering form of Zeus turn towards the now unarmoured warrior, glance towards her and then smirk. That was the motion, out of everything, that pierced through to her soul. The knowledge that in that moment, at the lowest point of her entire life, he was enjoying this.

Zeus cupped his hand and began to lift it slowly upwards, the warrior’s body matching the motion exactly.

“Please,” Zeus scoffed. “I created you; do you really think that you can best me?” He gently waved his hand through the air and the charging warrior dissipated into a wisp of air. Dani collapsed wretchedly onto the floor, staring up at the being that had simultaneously given her everything that she’d ever wanted and then immediately taken it away.

“Now then,” Zeus preened, turning towards her. “You. The cause of all of this mess.” Dani looked up at him and, as he had that morning, watched him shrink down into the size of a human person. He stroll towards her, his eyes never leaving her face.

“You secretly want this. I know you do,” he whispered. “Why else would you tease me with your presence all day? Why else would you keep me around?” The air around him shimmered as he walked, his form warping into a painfully recognisable one.

“I can even take the form of the man you love, if it will assuage your guilt,” he offered. He reached out a hand towards her. “Come,” he beckoned. “Come with me and you can have all you’ve ever wanted.”

Looking up at him, Dani saw a reflection of the being that had so desperately pleaded her for company not a few hours earlier. This was someone who had been raised, or had always existed in, such a supreme state of power that he deemed himself the sole progenitor for the decisions of others. In essence, a spoiled child throwing all of the toys out of the pram, unable, or unwilling, to see that someone could perceive of an existence that didn’t require his influence. It gave her a sense of pity that spurned her to do something that she didn’t think possible: Dani began to chuckle to herself.

She looked up at Zeus from the ground and saw the frailty in his form, the limitations, the doubt. She looked him directly in the eye and said with absolute conviction: “No.” Dani climbed to her feet and began to walk towards him. His face slipped slightly, before he waved an arm and she froze in place.

“You’re pathetic,” she whispered, careful to not break eye contact. “You won’t ever get me.” Zeus looked down at her feet and began to shake his head slowly, jaw set.

“Pity,” he said, the venom thick in his voice. He met her eye again and strolled over beside her. “You could have been one of my greatest.” He stroked a hand gently on her face. Dani kept her face implacable looked directly forwards. “The fire within you would have created a true semi-divine child that would have risen up; he would have given you everything you ever dreamed of. As would I.” He took a step back and spread his open palms towards her.

“I still could,” he offered. “I could bring your warrior child back; even your husband if it would keep you quiet.” Dani turned her head towards him.

“Zeus,” she muttered. “Shut the fuck up.”

Dani saw this set his face with a look of grim determination. “As you wish,” Zeus acknowledged. “My time is clearly wasted here.” He raised a hand into the air. “Any last words?” Dani stared at him resolutely. “Very well. This is going to hurt.” His hand dropped and Dani felt the magic flow from him; waves and eddies whirled about her before beginning to pierce the skin.

Her face twitched, but her face was set; her mind was made up. If this was how she went out, then she wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of knowing how much it hurt.

Ten seconds passed, but Dani still stood there, frozen in space but still alive.

“What have you done?” Zeus bellowed. “I command that you tell me.”  He repeated his previous motion, hand rising and falling, so again the energy again swirled around Dani, but again she stood there.

“You can’t do this to me,” Zeus screamed. “I’m free. I’m free. I’m free. I’m free. I’m free.” His arms flailed around with each exclamation but each time, Dani noticed, the amount of energy that he emitted was less than the time before. He collapsed forward onto his knees and began to lean on his hands. “You can’t be doing this,” he murmured.

A soft voice split the air.

“No,” it sang. “But I can.” In front of her, Dani saw a beam of light shimmer melting into a white pane of light. Out of it stepped a Woman so elegant that she defied true description. There was an undeniable height to her, but she still remained firmly within Dani’s sights.

Her beauty was of the degree only discussed in myth although she reminded Dani of herself. Nothing about this Woman, this otherworldly being, made sense, but a wave of safety and satisfaction washed over Dani nonetheless.

“Zeus,” the voice continued. “This is to be the last time.” The Woman had a slow and considered manner to her speech, with an intonation that neared a strangely familiar piece of music. Dani found herself enraptured with each word.

“Can you not see how far you’ve fallen?” the Woman asked. “I come here on behalf of the council and will act as your jury and even your executioner if necessary. Are you repentant for your sins?” Throughout all of this, Zeus had been staring intensely at Dani, a gaze which she returned in full force.

“But she’s mine!” Zeus cried, his voice cracking.

“I think that’s answer enough,” Dani quipped. The goddess turned towards her and a blinding sparkle of light shot across the place where her face would have been, signifying what may have been some form of a smile. Turning back to the cowering god in front of her, the being continued in her singsong voice.

“I have seen you act and I have found you wanting,” she intoned. “Outside of my duty as your prosecutor, you swore to me personally that you would never conduct yourself in this manner again.” Zeus looked up at her as though recognising her for the first time.

“Baby, please, I meant it. I didn’t do anything to her,” he begged. “I’m sorry. Please take me back.”

The avatar of light turned again towards Dani and began to glide towards her. As Dani watched her feet move they made no true contact with the floor, moving as though this entire sequence had been choreographed for her benefit.

“My sweet Danae,” the deity began. “As the aggrieved, you will decide the fate of this being.” A white arm swung around and pointed directly at Zeus. “Your will be done; now and forever.”

Zeus, wide-eyed and humbled, looked Dani firmly in the eye, shocked into silence by the absolute totality of the limitations placed upon him. Dani looked down at the face of the man who had murdered her husband, created and then destroyed her true born child - born from love and ripped to dust.

She felt a rage burning within her, a desire for revenge threatening to consume her, but she pushed it down; not repressed, but simply subdued. There was nothing that she could think to do to him that would alleviate the pressure from the void within her.

“Banish him,” she whispered, keeping her eyes locked on his. “Banish him from interfering in the world of men. Stop this from happening again.” Dani felt warmth on her shoulders and the powerful presence shifting immediately behind her.

“Alas, child,” Dani heard come down from above her. “If it were within our power, we would have done so in millenia past. What we can offer might placate these ideals, rather than alleviate them wholly: he will not be able interfere with you, your immediate family or any descendants that you may bear. Their entire lives will be free of the strife, of the interference from this creator.” Dani let out a large sigh before nodding once.

A loud clapping noise began an arc of energy that shot out towards Zeus. Striking him firmly in the chest, he grunted. Seconds later, he began to dissolve, face set, until, moments later, there was finally nothing left.

“It is done,” the holy voice announced. Dani turned around slowly, afraid that a quick move would startle the being away.

“What do I do now?” Dani asked tentatively. “I have nothing.” That sparkle of light again shot across the celestial avatar’s face.

“I wouldn’t say that,” she said softly, clearly amused. The goddess raised what would have been her arms and the air shimmered beside her, forging a portal very reminiscent of those that Dani had seen in the castle. Through it strolled a grinning, and very much unharmed, Dec, dressed in finery far greater than Dani had ever seen him in.

Her eyes opened wide and she was about to throw herself into his arms when she saw something in his arms: a bundle that he held very tenderly. He stopped beside the goddess and began to fiddle the cloth surrounding the bundle, his eyes locked onto it with intense admiration.

“I give you this gift as recompense for all you have been through,” the Woman sang. “Your one true love returned to you, bearing life’s greatest gift in the form that it was originally intended.” The avatar itself began to dissipate as it continued to speak.

“I wish you the best life and do hope that you find true happiness with each other. As promised, you will never encounter Zeus or any of his ilk ever again.” With that, the Woman that wasn’t quite a woman began to drift apart, the energy spreading harmlessly into the surroundings.

Dani reached out and took Dec’s free hand. The motion broke him out of his reverie and he looked up at her and they immediately shared a grin. Before either of them could speak a word, the sound of a ringing crystal split the air and they both began to look around them.

“One more thing before I leave you,” the soft voice said, surrounding them in velvet. “I heard that this castle is looking for a new master.” Dani and Dec’s eyes met once more. Together, they turned towards the towering castle and began to stroll across the swarded plains, arm in arm.

“You know what?” Dec pondered. “I’ve always wanted to be a king.” Dani punched him on the shoulder.

“Oh please,” she scoffed. “You’ll be lucky if I make you a prince.” A brisk wind picked up and began to buffet Dani’s hair. Impulsively leaning in closer to Dec, she reached over and moved some of the surrounding cloth away from their child’s face.

“Who do we have here then?” she cooed. “Did she tell you if it was a boy or a girl?” Dec paused for a moment before he answered.

“King Declan the first,” he whispered. “I like the sound of that.” Dani punched him in the arm again, grinning.

“Shut up,” she laughed.
