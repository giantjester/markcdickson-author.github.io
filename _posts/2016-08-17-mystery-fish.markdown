There are moments in life when you realise why you keep that certain person in your life. For some, this might be a life partner; a girlfriend, a boyfriend, whatever label you decide to put on each other. Others might find this solace in a parent, sibling or even simply a friend.

I had one of these moments happen to me recently and I don’t want to let the moment slip by without logging it; I need to bottle that feeling up because it’s something that I don’t ever want to completely forget.

Even after everything else has disappeared, when this fragile youth has slipped away from me, I still want to remember how I felt in this moment, when there was a true sense of balance and serenity. I don’t know who you are and I don’t know how you’ve found this notebook, but I need you to know where I’ve come from so that you can understand where this story is going. It begins, as everything does, at the beginning.

It feels like a platitude to be writing down into words at this point, but I had a perfectly acceptable childhood; never really wanting for anything, but sticking firmly within my comfort zone. I was never the person who had classmates around after school.

It wasn’t that I lacked friends, it’s more that I never felt the need to invite them deeper into my life. We never lacked the necessities, but the games consoles, the bread-and-butter of growing up in the early 2000s, were conspicuously absent. I ended up spending a significant amount of time around other people’s houses; ever the perpetual guest and never the host.

Therefore, when it came to a time when I could provide for myself as a young adult, although I publicly espoused a commitment to the contrary, I never felt like I could be the gracious host that I wanted to be. I would go to work, declarations of my frivolities bounding off the walls, then come home and spend the night alone. All of this changed when, by sheer chance and some sense of divine providence, I met Shaun.

As much as I’d like to say so to appeal to whatever romantic ideals you hold in your mind, we didn’t fall in love at first sight. We got on, sure, but we didn’t immediately look at each other and want to rip each other’s clothes off or ride into the sunset together. It was a friendship that grew naturally, serving as a foundation for when we eventually took it to the next level. I learned to let him in and he learned to not take what I said or did at immediate face value.

He was this dichotomous ideal of everything that I wanted in a partner from the beginning; too many similarities and you either immediately clash or eventually drive each other insane. If we'd lived our lives as I used to live mine back then, there’s no chance in hell that we’d have made it. Similarly, if he’d pulled too hard too quickly, then we’d have imploded just as absolutely. It was the dynamic tug-of-war between us that kept us each growing and twisting in our own ways.

My parents were left wanting when their bright little boy brought home poor report cards, but they got past it. They were disappointed when their only son dropped out of college to spend every day at home religiously playing computer games, but they got me a job and forced me to move out into my own place.

When I brought home my first boyfriend, it was different, something that they could never fully get behind. Verbally they, if reluctantly, told me that “supported my life decision” but, if you can’t guess from the vitriolic quotes, our relationship was never quite the same after that.

Life charged on regardless of the depth of my interactions with my parents and I soon found myself working my way up the corporate ladder. I transitioned from worker drone to team-manager drone to floor-manager drone and my wage consistently increased, but my satisfaction with it kind of plateaued early on.

It was never anything more than a job to me and it seemed like, no matter how much money I earned, there never seemed to quite be enough to go around. Bills would go up or something would break and me and Shaun would have to scramble as a couple to get the money together.

My relationship with Shaun continued to grow, regardless of the stress that the outside world placed upon us. Sure we fought, what couple doesn’t, but we managed to keep pulling together and building on what came before.

When I met Shaun, the entirety of my life suddenly made sense; it’s a cliché, but allow me a moment of self-indulgence. I was realising who I was at the same time that I was discovering who he was. It’s not an easy thing to do, to grow together, so we were forced to have a handful of immensely uncomfortable conversations to decide exactly where we wanted to go with this.

Shaun helped me to become who I wanted to be, supporting me wholly and unconditionally, while I did the same to him in return. Granted, he pretty much already knew who he was when we met so it was mostly unidirectional, but we helped each other along regardless. We had the classic buddy cop dynamic that so much media strives for: I’m too uptight and focus on the order that rigidity gives you, while he is far more about experiencing the journey and slowing down the smell the roses.

With all of that setup in place, this brings us to last night. For a smaller, but still vital, context, Shaun and I had been invited to attend my sister’s wedding. It was the grand ol’ affair that so many of these unions are and, this is key component of the story here, it involved a hell of a lot of alcohol. The ceremony itself went off without any major hitches, nothing that she’ll remember anyway, and the entire party settled into a night of drinking and dancing.

The room buzzed with laughter and conversation, with people standing around the dining tables and heading onto the dance-floor when the beat took hold of them. The DJ played a scattering of songs that I could truly sink my teeth into, but the lingering stink-eye of my parents drove me from the dance-floor more than I’d care to admit. Nevertheless, me and Shaun stuck it out until the end, watching family and friends slowly file out, until, finally, we were part of the group around when the lights came on.

Despite the jovial atmosphere surrounding me, I found myself trapped in a mood that I couldn’t entirely explain. I knew that I should feel a deeper connection to the others in this shared experience at the end of a night that we'd remember forever, but I found myself anchored in a dining chair, alone, in the corner of the ballroom. Shaun strolled over from the centre of the dance-floor, took one look at me and grabbed my hand, dragging me out of the hall and into the rest of the house.

The stately home that my sister had hired for her wedding was gorgeous. Ornate decorations covered each cabinet that we passed, floral wallpaper bounding alongside us on the walls as we ran, hands clasped together, the house standing as a testament to the integrity only possible from the decadence of times past; this mansion was old when we were new and would still be here when we left.

Shaun silently lead me through the hallways, heading for the nearest garden, guiding me into the night. As soon as we burst through the tremendous doors together, we stopped and took in the scene, Shaun’s eyes immediately flitting to the sky above us.

He gazed longingly up at the scattering of stars and I found my eyes locked onto him, trying desperately to siphon some of the wonder with which he viewed the world. Not too long later, Shaun brought his gaze down to meet mine and whispered “Follow me.” He squeezed my hand then let it go, immediately shooting off deeper into the darkness. I stayed on his heels, lost in the reverie of his presence, bounding over invisible obstacles and skittering across fields of wet grass.

We soon found ourselves on the edge of the property’s fish pond. It was by no means the demonstration of wealth that the rest of the house tended to imply, but it was still an impressive display. A small spout spurted water in a dome from the very centre, but the rest of the water was lost to the night. Shaun squatted at the edge of the pond and placed his hand lightly onto the surface of the water.

“I can’t see any of the fish,” he observed. “The surface of the water looks entirely black.” He turned his head towards me and gestured with his free hand. “Come over here and look.”

I knelt beside Shaun and he grasped my hand in his.

“It’s so strange that we know that they’re there, but we don’t have any idea where they are,” he mused. “It's a mystery; they’re all a bunch of mystery fish.” He laughed to himself.

“I have no idea what that means,” he chuckled. “Maybe I’m more drunk than I thought.” Shaun turned and looked at me, that coy grin making me realise exactly why I was still there, still with him. He leaned forwards slightly and kissed me on the forehead.

“Come on,” he whispered, getting to his feet, pulling me with him. “Let’s keep going.” We walked around the side of the house and a new part of the garden came into focus. Shaun let go of my hand again and bounded ahead, looking around himself at the lush grass, murmuring quietly to himself.

“Here.” He gestured at a spot next to him before flopping down onto the grass on his back, immediately resuming his inspection of the sky. I walked over to him, sticking my head into his field of view.

“Isn’t it just horribly wet?” I asked. Shaun scoffed and starting pulling on my hand again.

“Look how many stars there are,” he mused, moving his head to look behind me. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many stars before.” He patted the ground next to him, not breaking his gaze. I squatted down and brushed the top of the grass with my fingers; they came away unquestionably damp. I turned towards him when he interrupted me.

“Don’t even think about it,” he said. “Lie down now or I’ll pull you down.” I raised my eyebrows incredulously, beginning to form a retort, when he gently pushed me so that I rolled onto my back.

There was a second when I started to complain before I caught a glimpse of the sky. The way that the blackness stretched endlessly above me coalesced with the strangely familiar positioning of the stars and I lost myself.

I wasn’t a boyfriend in that moment; I wasn’t a son either. Everything that I was, all of the problems that I thought were so important, faded away and I got to experience what I can only describe as bliss for the first time in my life. I felt Shaun’s hand brush against mine as it fell from his torso onto the grass. I reached for it and felt his hand rotate to fit into mine.

“I love you,” I heard him say. I squeezed his hand, not wanting to break my reverie in the moment. I thought about the night. I thought about our previous nights together. I thought about my parents. I squeezed his hand again, not taking my eyes off the sky.

“I love you too,” I whispered.
