The room that he lived in was not one of his own choosing, but it was nonetheless the place that he wanted to be. The entire space took up less space than the average kitchen, not that he could truly remember what a kitchen was, but it was ample for the life that he lived.

If someone had told you that the room had been carved from a single block of linoleum, then you would have believed them. It was reflective to such a degree that each surface took the only source of light in the room, the overhead halogen bulbs, and bounced it around as enthusiastically as possible.

Where the walls were an unbroken sheet of luminescence, the floor had been split at regular intervals, creating a grid pattern that lead from one side of the room to the other. There were 864 tiles on the floor in total. Whether you worked that out from counting each tile individually or by simply multiplying the lengths of each side together, the result was the same.

The white had been garish at first, but it had quickly disarmed him. All corners of the room were illuminated and the eternal daytime had become all that he could remember.

His bed was positioned in the exact centre of the room, the area on the floor surrounding it marked out by a startlingly red outline. The bed gave the ideal view of the big screen in his room without picking up any of the potential glare from the overhead lights. Something was currently playing in the background, the laugh track piercing the silence of the room, but his mind was currently somewhere else.

There was a time when all of this would have been inconceivable. He didn’t know exactly when that time had been, but there was a lingering knowledge that there had been something before.

The chronologically first memory that he possessed was of this room: waking up a position very close to the one that he was in now.

He had been lying on his back, each arm lying neatly on either side of him. Without any actual knowledge, or even any awareness that there should have been knowledge, he’d sat up. The light in the room was bright enough to force him to a squint at first exposure, but low enough that his eyes eventually got used to it.

To his right, pressed tightly up against the wall he saw a silver toilet, bowl and cistern irreversibly connected. To his left, nothing. There was nothing else in the room that he could see.

There weren’t any signs as to where he was, nor was there any instruction as to what he should do next. Feeling reasonably content with his current state of being, the weight of his eyes had overtaken him, so he’d simply laid down and gone back to sleep.

It was only when he’d been woken a certain number of hours later with his stomach gurgling, that he had taken the initiative to swing his legs over the side of the bed and rise to his feet.

That was the moment in which he noticed the large rectangle on the wall. His headboard had been facing the wall that it was on and he’d missed it.

While both the rectangle and the toilet were both visible to him, the latter was a purely silver, reflective surface, whereas the former had a white matte effect to it. He'd thought to himself that that had probably been the reason why he’d missed it at a first glance. He had also considered for a moment that perhaps it had been placed there or been made more prominent in the interim time in which he had been asleep.

What he couldn’t comprehend was how he’d not seen the large buttons just below it, protruding a couple of inches outwards.

As he'd tip-toed up to the offending wall, the rectangle, which he could now recognise as a screen, had flickered to life. It was wider than his shoulder-width and possessed an extraordinarily thin border.

There was a simple question displayed on it in thick, blue text that gave him a moment’s hesitation.

“Do you wish to leave your Comfort Zone?”

The buttons on either side of The Screen had blipped and both had changed to a unique colour. The one to the left had turned a pallid shade of green, with white text emblazened across it that spelled out the word “YES”. The colour invoked memories of some distant field; faceless children darted around him, but not with him.

Back in the white room, he had raised one hand to his own face and felt its features. In the memory, he knew that he was like the others but definitively not one of them.

The opposing button was a rich ruby red. Contrary to its anemic neighbour, its white text showed the single word “NO”.

The memory associated with this colour was one of laughter, of a feeling of comradery and belonging. People that he knew were gathered around a large table, drawing him in with their eyes, their words. He didn’t know who these people were, but he knew that wanted to spend just that little bit more time with them.

He had punched the Red Button with a closed fist.

Instantly, the ominous message on The Screen had flickered off, leaving him alone again with the now black rectangle. He'd turned to head back to his bed when he'd heard the sound of static behind him, quickly replaced with the sound of chatter. He had spun around expecting some kind of visitor, but instead saw a bunch of talking heads on The Screen.

One of the heads had said a few sentences before laughter spilled out of the speakers, replacing the silence in the room with something strangely more hollow. Nevertheless, he had loved it. He'd immediately perched on the end of the bed, legs dangling, and had stared at The Screen until his stomach started to growl again, more vivaciously this time.

At the sound, The Screen had switched off and another hidden compartment had sprung out of the infamous wall. The smell that had wafted in had been enticing, heightened even further by his now ravenous hunger. There had been no way for him to know how long it had been since he’d been absorbed into The Screen, but his hunger had warped into its own cogent and unwavering being.

It had leapt at the food and crammed as much as it could into itself with an unbelievable voracity. When the creature had been placated, he had taken a staggering step backwards, slightly overwhelmed by the entire experience.

His close proximity to The Screen had reactivated the harbinger of change.

“Do you wish to leave your Comfort Zone?”

His eyes had sprung open and he'd slammed the bright Red Button as quickly as his human reflexes would allow. An overwhelming sense of control had coursed through his veins.

The option had been right in front of him, free of any strings now that he’d been both rested and fed, and he’d rejected it. His existence was now idyllic; there was no need to leave when he had everything that he could ever remember wanting. No matter what had come before, this was unquestionably better.

For subsequent trips towards The Wall, as Food continued to appear whenever his body announced any indication that it was hungry, he would snatch it off the shelf that it arrived on and dart back to the bed. That way, when The Compartment would withdraw again, he was at a distance that reactivated The Program instead of The Message.

This was how he lived now; this was the status quo.

Without any form of natural light, he existed in a perpetual daytime that moved at a pace that he desired, with Program after Program appearing on The Screen for him to consume. When the first one concluded, a new one started. How they were produced and who the people in them were didn’t matter to him; the content was there so he inhaled it greedily.

When he tired of consuming media this way, he would turn from The Screen and it would deactivate. Surprisingly to him, there was something to be gained from this silence. Sometimes he would eventually drift off to sleep, but other times he would simply lie there, lost in his own thoughts.

Eventually, as one is want to do in times like these, he began to question his own existence. The first time that a thought such as this popped into his head, he impulsively recoiled from it and bolted up to get his Programs back.

But it wasn’t to be quelled so easily.

What started out as a simple seed of a question blossomed into a bright bunch of possible answers. Soon, their weight grew and grew as his mind continued to expand and soon, the possibilities were all that he could think of. Were there other people like him? Did they have their own Screens? What Programs did they like to watch?

Then one day, as he was receiving his second Meal since his last sleep, he found himself fighting against the impulse to run back to his Bed with the food. Keeping the sandwich clutched tightly in both hands, he bored holes into The Screen with his eyes as he heard the mechanical components of The Compartment whir as it closed.

The Screen flickered.

“Do you wish to leave your Comfort Zone?”

Moving his sandwich to one hand, he took a step to the left of the screen. He made a fist with his free hand and began hovering it over the Green Button. For the first time, the rich colour meant something else to him.

It no longer made him worry about those lonely green fields.

It meant all of the trees in the world and all of the mystery hidden within them; the way that they gained a heightened strength and a more intense mystery simply by existing together. It was a frosted wreath hanging on the front of a door, inspiring cheer despite the bite in the air; it was an invitation inside for momentary relief, harmonious with the uplifting atmosphere inside.

He glanced over at the bloody Red Button. It was still as inviting as it had ever been and probably always would be; but he’d done that. Now he needed to see what else was out there.

The closed fist punched the Green Button.

For the last time, he thought about the laughter and the adventure that he’d experienced while living here. Underneath all of the apprehension that he had for what came next, he knew that he could always come back here for more.

The entire wall then began to rumble. The buttons began to move up the wall of their own volition and he took an instinctual step back. That gave him the perspective that he needed to see that the entirely of the wall was rising. The Screen soon disappeared into the ceiling, quickly followed by the buttons. Grooves in the wall were beginning to show on either side and found himself wondering if the entirety of this room actually slid together.

Taking a bite from the sandwich in his hand, he hunched over forwards in an attempt to get a quick glimpse under the wall. All he could see was more of the same as in his own room; white was the colour of choice of the designer of this building and they’d embraced it.

Regardless, he stood there and patiently waited for the wall to fully disappear into the ceiling, munching on the sandwich, not quite sure what he would do next.

The wall finally vanished with a loud click. The place that he’d been so content in for such an extended period of time was no longer. He turned behind him and saw his Comfort Zone, as if for the first time.

It looked small. It looked dirty. The bedsheets had been the same since he’d moved in and there appeared to be a general layer of grime over everything. He knew that the world outside had none of these properties and he was ecstatic to experience it all for the first time.

There was another loud click behind him.

He turned to see a row of five people, all of various shapes and sizes and all dressed in thick black leather, pointing large semi-automatic machine guns in his direction. Puzzled, he squinted his eyes and stared at them wordlessly. Unfortunately for him, they didn’t return the favour. A distorted, loud voice rang throughout the room.

“You left your Comfort Zone. This cannot be accepted.”

Without any apparent compunction, they all fired in unison.

The sandwich was one of his favourites: a thick, chunky slice of beef, a little dollop of horseradish, but not too much, and a healthy heaping of both tomato and lettuce.

As if in slow motion, it arched into the air, bread coming unstuck from filling, the air becoming a flurry of red and green. A hand misguidedly reached out for it as it fell and managed to catch a finger on a single piece of bread, smearing the butter.

The sandwich had only been born into life moments before, but bore witness to the end of The Subject that had dwelt for the longest in the Comfort Zone. The Subject that had become something of a prize possession of the observing dignitaries.

The sandwich had been his last Comfort before the end.

As he laid face pressed against the floor, for the force of the bullets had not quite been enough to push him backwards, his fingers twitched towards what remained of the sandwich.

The comfort had gone. The blissful ignorance had gone. Everything that he previously thought of as lasting forever was now out of his reach. The Wall. The Compartment. The Screen.

But he still had that sandwich.

That was still a possibility.

And he would literally kill himself reaching for it.
