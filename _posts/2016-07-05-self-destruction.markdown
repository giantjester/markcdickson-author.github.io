June felt her shoulder start to come out of the socket as her arm was twisted behind her. Pushing back into the assailant, her entire body weight was enough to get some breathing room. Elbowing with her free left arm, she found herself futilely striking air.

Grunting in frustration as the fierce grip returned to twist up her right arm, she decided to make the Hail Mary pass that she'd been taught not to make. Consequences could come later; she needed to be free of this hold.

Squatting and then immediately extending her legs, June threw herself and the body behind her into the wall. She heard a gasp for air behind her and, staggering forward, looked around for something to grab.

Wooden swords adorned the walls at regular intervals, intermittently spaced out by staves, shields and the occasional disassembled spear. Diving for the nearest plain staff, June turned it into a forward roll and turned to face her winded opponent.

“What did I tell you about doing that?” the other combatant panted, pushing her mop of hair out of her eyes. “You leave the risk of injuring yourself for very little gain.” June effortlessly twirled the thin staff between her fingers and started grinning beatifically.

“I would say sorry, Melka” June smirked, spinning the weapon up into the air and catching it deftly with the other hand, “but we both know I wouldn't mean it.”

Sighing, Melka grabbed one of the longest wooden swords from a nearby rack. Gripping the hilt with two hands, she charged at her student. The weapons thudded together, sword arching down and staff rising to meet it.

Immediately pulling apart, the two combatants both spun, tried again and were met with the same resounding clatter. Taking a step back, Melka watched for the next move.

June took a step forwards with her left foot with both hands on the base of the staff and swung with the totality of her upper body strength. Her teacher effortlessly parried the blow and hit the staff up into the air; June managed to maintain a grip on the weapon but immediately regretted leaving herself exposed.

Continuing on the motion from the parry, Melka readjusted her hands on the hilt, twirling the sword itself as she did so and pointed the point towards the ground. Her toughed muscles tensed as she drove the weapon firmly and vertically downwards into the unprotected foot.

Although the wooden weapon was designed as a protection against bloodshed, with the right application it could be as deadly as any correspondingly metal version. The blunt end jammed into June's foot and was followed by the subsequent howling from the girl herself.

“WHAT THE ACTUAL...?” June spat, dropping her staff on the floor to grab at her foot. “ARE YOU INSA...?” Pulling the sword back up in line with her torso, Melka again gripped the hilt with two hands and swung it through the air. It hit June's head with a loud crack and she fell to the side, clutching her head.

Melka strode over to her student and firmly addressed the child, letting the sword fall to her side.

“If you continue to act like a child,” Melka began. “Then I will punish you like a child.” Melka began to pace, idly spinning the sword around and passing it from hand to hand. “When I tell you to not throw yourself into your attacker, I'm not doing it for my protection, I'm doing it for yours.” Melka turned to face her student.

“You beg to get into my class. I say no. You try to bribe your way into my class. I, again, turn you away. Months and months of begging and pleading later, I finally agree to let you in and you ignore my first lesson.” June pushed herself onto her arms and looked up, dazed, as Melka squatted down in front of her to deliver the final line.

“You're exactly like your father used to be.”

June's face set and she reacted instinctively. Pushing herself off the ground with her left arm, she threw all of her weight into her right hook, catching Melka square on the jaw. Head throbbing, June threw herself at the discarded staff and, scrambling, pushed herself to her feet and again stared down her opponent. Melka glared back at her with a fierce determination, mixed in with a little something else.

Panting heavily, June charged, again leading with her left foot. As Melka slowly began the process of parrying another of the same, June threw the staff up in the air and, spinning, caught it with her right hand. Using the momentum from the spin to swing the weapon, June again heard the air rush from her teacher's lungs as the staff hit her firmly in the chest.

Even surprised, Melka didn't miss a beat. Taking an instinctive step back, she swung wildly with the sword and forced June to reconsider her position. Deciding to this time take the initiative, Melka swung the sword in a downward arc, using the space to put her entire body into it. June stumbled backwards to avoid the blow and found herself looking up at the towering woman, still gripping the staff. Crabwalking quickly backwards, June found herself pressed up against one of the walls.

“This was even easier than I thought it would be,” Melka gloated, throwing her sword to the side and striding forwards. “You're clearly not ready for this class and now I’ve proved it.” As June tilted her head back and banged it on the wall, she caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of her eye. Turning her head to the left to look at it, still breathing deeply, she saw her chance.

June turned back to look up at her teacher, smirking and moving her staff to her right hand. Despite her self-indulgent soliloquy, Melka hadn’t missed the sidewards glance. Both made their move at the same instant.

Using the strength in her legs, June pushed herself up into the wall, using it to support herself as she returned to a standing position. Melka dived at the sword that she’d haphazardly discarded. June grabbed the ornate bo staff in her left hand and threw herself towards the other woman, finding her still on her knees. Despite this, Melka managed to rise the sword to parry the first swing of the thin staff. However, the bo staff, coming an instant later, connected with her right shoulder. Immediately losing feeling in that arm, Melka switched her grip solely to her left hand.

June pressed on, combining the two weapons into a single attack and swung full-force into the wooden sword. The weight of the weapon was too much to support with a single hand and Melka lost her grip, the sword scattering across the floor.

June span on the spot, using her weight to gather momentum for the two weapons and struck her tormentor directly in the face; coincidentally, Melka took a path across the floor similar to the one her sword had taken. Not convinced that her foe was fully down, June moved her feet a shoulder’s width apart and readied the two staves in either hand.

Melka pushed herself up from the ground and looked over her shoulder at June. Feeling something warm dripping down her face, she wiped it away and, realising that it was blood, pushed herself to her feet. Melka walked over to her sword, spitting blood onto the wooden floor. Bending over to pick it up, she allowed herself a quick smile of satisfaction. Setting her face again, she turned towards her student, sword ready.

“Good. Again.”
