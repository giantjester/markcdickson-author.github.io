Cerise hesitated for a moment before she spoke, thinking through her choice of words.

“There’s still one thing that I need to know from you,” Cerise inquired. “How did I end up here? The last thing that I remember is walking down that side street and I saw a…” She paused. What had she seen?

The Spiraliser immediately smacked himself in the forehead with his open palm, interrupting the formation of her memories.

“Of course. I’m such an idiot,” he cursed. “Stupid, stupid, stupid.” Each new word came with a new hit to the head.

“Hey now,” Cerise soothed. “You don’t need to do that. You can just tell me.” The Spiraliser took a quick step towards her and leaned in towards her, bearing his teeth slightly.

“Of course I can,” he spat. “I know that.” In a moment, the scowl disappeared from his face and he righted himself, grabbing his fringe with one hand, eyes wide.

“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” he babbled. “I’ve not been sleeping at all, have I told you that?” Cerise interrupted him before he could descend too far into this, wracking her brain for some fiction trope that she knew.

“I know. I know,” she soothed. “I completely understand; it must be really hard fighting the dastardly King Crocodile. Were you out on patrol or something when you found me?” Sniffling, he perked up.

“Yeah, I was! Maybe you have heard of me!” he blubbered. Briefly shaking his head as if to clear it, The Spiraliser dove back into his monologue.

“Before I tell you what I was doing last night, you need to know what the state of the superhero world is at the moment,” he proclaimed, raising a finger at her. He began to pace from wall to wall. “King Crocodile has taken his fight against me to the next level and has decided to eradicate me completely. When last we met, he was sure to inform me that I would never again be able to impede upon his schemes as I have been. To this end, he, as he had me momentarily tied up, told me that he would begin expanding his research into transformative and hallucinogenic potions.”

Throughout all of this, Cerise kept feeling brief mental twinges of recognition. It was as if she’d heard all of this before. Had she read all of this in the news, or perhaps somewhere else? Cerise was broken out of her reverie by a large hand waving in front of her face.

“Hellooo?” The Spiraliser called. “Am I boring you with my story?” Flinching, Cerise shook her head.

“No, of course not,” she muttered.

The Spiraliser regained his full stature and dove straight back into his story as though he’d never been interrupted.

“So that brings us to last night,” he continued, again pointing his index finger, but this time into the air. “You say that you remember somebody approaching you in an alleyway? What you weren’t to know was that was in fact King Croc himself, jumping out to inject you with his new invention. I scared him back into the sewers when I bravely propelled myself through the adjacent building, but not before he managed to exclaim a warning that this rescue would be my final undoing; that you personally would be the last person that I would ever save.

“NEVERTHELESS! I knew that I couldn’t leave you alone to rot from the inside, so I wrapped my arms around you as you began to twist and melt into a disturbing human/crocodile hybrid. Luckily, I managed to drag you here and constrain you before you were able to transform too much. Your life had been well and truly saved, all thanks to me,”

As he concluded, he turned towards her expectantly, a hopeful, yet coy, grin on his face. Cerise paused for a second, considering her words before she spoke. Drawing a blank, she said the first thing that popped into her head: “Wow.”

All colour drained from The Spiraliser’s face and he, again, quickly closed the space between them. He rested one hand on each of the arms of the chair.

“‘Wow’?! That’s all you can say?!” he exclaimed. “I go out there, night after night, risking my life for ungrateful people like you and all you can say is ‘Wow’?!” He pushed off from the chair and began frantically shaking his head.

“Jesus fucking Christ. This again,” he cursed. “Ungrateful little people like this not understanding why I do what I do even though I do it entirely for their benefit and I risk my life for people like this and then they…”

The Spiraliser got quieter and quieter until Cerise could no longer hear his words; he did, fortunately for her, continue to pace in front of her. Cerise continued to strain against her bonds, rubbing her skin raw, but was starting to feel some slack in the rope.

As she wriggled, finding herself suddenly thankful that the legs of the chair were even, she looked around the room for what felt like the hundreth time to see if there was anything there that she could use. As she did so, she again caught a glimpse of a glint of light from outside. There was no way that that was a passing car; that was a person. She was interrupted by The Spiraliser’s abrupt spin to face her.

“No. You know what?” he asked, clearly rhetorically. “I don’t need to stand here and take this. There are people out there who need me.” Reaching a hand behind him, he pulled out a medical syringe that was full of a viscous transparent liquid. Before this, Cerise realised, she’d been dealing with the situation uncharacteristically calmly; it had all seemed to be some form of prank where the curtain was eventually going to be pulled back. This changed things.

“Oh god,” she gasped. “Please don’t. I don’t want to…please I’m sorry you don’t have to.” Seeing her panic, The Spiraliser smirked.

“Look. I’m not going to hurt you with this,” he explained. “Although I’m glad that you’re finally taking me seriously.” He took a step towards her but, this time, the approach felt far more sinister. Cerise started squirming in the chair frantically, ropes cutting deep into her wrists, but, despite her fear, she could feel the knot loosening.

“Please please please…I’m sorry,” she pleaded, leaning as far away from the man as she could. “What are you doing to me?”

The Spiraliser got within a foot of her and squatted, placing the syringe gently on the ground next to him. As he looked up at her, a genuine and kind smile on his face, empty palms facing towards her, Cerise found him more terrifying than she ever had before.

“I’m sorry that I just sprung this on you,” he soothed, gesturing to the syringe on the floor. “I’ve been dosing you regularly with this all day; it’s an antidote for the poison that you’ve been injected with. It stops the hallucinations and prevents you from transforming again.”

“No, no, no, no, no, no” Cerise babbled, tears flooding down her face. “Please, please, please don’t.” He sighed, picking up the syringe.

“If it’s any consolation, this is the last dose,” he comforted, leaning in towards her and placing a hand gently on the side of her head. “You know that you’re being a classic woman and completely overreacting, right?”

Despite Cerise’s overwhelming fear, this little piece of condescension immediately snapped her out of all of it. She saw past the muscle and the costume and right into the scared little boy below it all. There was no chance that she was going to sit here and be anybody’s little damsel in distress. Cerise sniffed, trying to think of a way to keep him talking to give herself more time.

“Please let me make this all up to you. I’ll do anything,” she begged. As she talked, she kept convulsing as though she was still flinching from his touch, but instead used the shifting weight to free her hands.

“I’m sorry that I’ve scared you,” The Spiraliser answered. “But I’m genuinely only doing this to help you.” As he moved the syringe into position right by her neck, Cerise impulsively flinched away from it. As she did so, the movement in her arms caused the bonds around her wrists to fully come apart. With a reaction time that she didn’t previously know that she possessed, Cerise grabbed hold of the ropes before they could hit the ground and give her away.

Cerise knew that she had to wait for the perfect moment to attack. As the point of the syringe got closer and closer to her neck, she sat there tensed – poised ready to pounce. She twitched as the needle went into her neck.

“It’ll be over before you know it and then we can talk about letting you…” The Spiraliser started to say, trying to get in a last monologue before pushing the plunger. This was when Cerise saw her chance.

Whirling the rope around, she caught The Spiraliser directly in the face, the weight of the rope suddenly working for her benefit.

“Mother-fuc…” he yelled, falling backwards onto the floor. Cerise grabbed the syringe and, wincing, pulled it out of her neck, hoping against hope that she hadn’t damaged anything. She knew that her only chance was to get whomever that person was outside to help her get free; there was no way that she’d be able to break down those boards herself. Cerise ran to the windows and started to bang furiously on the planks that covered them.

Except she didn’t. What Cerise hadn’t accounted for was the fact that her ankles were still bound to the chair. Hours ago, all significant blood flow to her feet had disappeared, causing her to lose feeling in them. As Cerise threw her weight diagonally in front of her, expecting to rise to her feet and head towards the window, she instead came crashing to the floor, chair and all.

As she lay there on the floor, winded from her efforts, The Spiraliser stood towering over her, apprehensively wiping the blood off his face.

“You ungrateful little bitch,” he spat, squatting down next to her. “If I weren’t a hero, right now you’d be taking a beating.” The Spiraliser reached behind him again and pulled out another syringe. “Luckily for you, I am a hero. And you’re going to get this antidote whether you like it or not.” He roughly jabbed the needle into her neck and pushed the plunger down.

“I’ll be back soon,” he sighed. “I hope you’ll be more grateful then.”

Then Cerise forgot how to think for a while.
