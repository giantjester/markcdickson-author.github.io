*“Hey. It’s Claire. Yeah, I’m still coming.”*

She kept up the pace, even though her feet were starting to ache; there was something cathartic about walking barefoot in the rain. The night had become so out of hand so quickly that it was a relief to feel some kind of solid connection to the ground beneath her feet.

The heel of one of her shoes stuck out of the carrier bag in her left hand and jostled the plastic as she walked. As Beth's question came down the phone, Claire turned around and looked at the road she’d just walked down.

“Yeah. He’ll be there," Claire confirmed. "He’s back at home and then he’ll get a cab as soon as he’s done.”

She bristled at the lie; there were far too many questions that she didn’t want to deal with right now.

When they were younger, Beth had always been the one to take charge. It was her job to make sure that Claire didn’t screw up her life. Even 25 years later, it was a habit and a relationship that wasn’t going to change.

There was an awning up ahead and Claire started to make a beeline for it.

"He wasn’t feeling great and decided to…” Claire tried.

The bag hit the floor with a loud clang as Claire reached the outcrop of material. The bright neon green was garishly luminescent, but she needed a brief respite and turned from it. From experience, she knew that she wouldn’t be able to placate her cousin quickly. As Claire listened to the onslaught of enquiries, she bent over and checked that she hadn’t smashed the bottle; it might only be $15 worth, but her shoes were worth far more than that.

Claire righted herself and adjusted the phone to her other ear.

“Look. I’m fine. Nothing’s happened. It’s just pouring and the taxi got…” she began.

The voice on the other end of the line cut her off.

This wasn’t what she needed right now. Six years of her life were getting flushed down the drain and she didn’t need to hear confirmation of her mistakes to know that there was no going back. Each time she tried to explain herself, the volume of the voice raving down the phone simply got louder.

Claire tried to soothe her.

“I know you’ve been working really hard on this party. You don’t need to worry about us…”

This time the interruption actually bugged her.

As the rain pounded down on the cover above her, she was suddenly immensely glad that she was alone. This was one of the busiest cities in the world, but she still always managed to somehow make it her own. Smashing, screaming and sobbing aside, she find herself thinking how lucky she was to be here. So many people tried to make it here; she was one of the lucky few who had managed it.

There was an art to dealing with Beth: grunting at well timed intervals was the best way to ride out her well-intentioned tirades.

As Claire's mind started to wander, she found herself thinking about the event that had lead her here. It was just a single text message that had set the spiral off. A badly timed and poorly worded text message and she was suddenly left wondering if she had a place to go home to. It was her fault that it had happened; it was destined to happen at some point. Was it actually even her fault?

She snapped out of her inner soliloqy.

“I know I know," Claire said. "Look; I’m almost at your place and then I can explain it better. It’s not even a big…”

But it was wasn’t it? They were on their way to the party and he’d asked her. After everything that had happened that evening, he’d still asked her. In the middle of the street; in front of everyone.

Claire shook her head violently to one side, dislodging the water that had dripped into her ear. There was an innocence to him that she’d never fully deserved; now it had torn them irreperably apart. Maybe that was why she had done it. It was her fault that it had happened.

A second wine glass here. A few lost hours there. There had been so many close-calls and near-misses that had slipped past his attention, but it was the text message that had eventually broken the news. Why hadn’t that made a difference to his decision? There had been so many warning signs from both sides and they’d all slipped past notice because there was something else in the moment more deserving of their attention. A weekend spent in the office. An emergency trip down to lay a family member to rest. There was always a reason not to deal with the problem when it arose and they took it at every opportunity.

Claire knew that she needed to start dealing with her problems head on. This needed to begin with Beth; Claire knew that it was her turn to talk and she was going to utilise it as best she could.

“We’re not perfect but we’re working on it," she spat. "You and Greg aren’t exactly dealing with marital bliss right now.”

She instantly regretted it. It set Beth off with fresh ammunition.

There was a chance that this party could have made everyting okay again. Underneath all of the bravado, Beth always knew what to say and how to say it; she’d be the reasonable one, Claire would whine and moan and then everything would end fixed with a kiss and a band-aid. There might have been a chance for a nice glass of wine; two or three if she was lucky.

Claire heard her phone receive a notification. She debated whether or not Beth’s new tirade was more important.

She hung up.

As she looked down at her phone, she saw his face staring up at her; a glimpse of a time when their relationship had mattered to her: they'd been three adventures away from the end of their epic “Top 10 Things to Do” and had found themselves face-to-face with either the friendliest or least appropriate giraffe that she’d ever met.

It had become something of a competition between them that day: whoever could touch the most animals would get to choose the restaurant that night. This giraffe may have won Claire the bet, but they didn’t end up going to the restaurant.

She put the phone back in her pocket.

Claire flopped down onto the ground next to her bags. Leaning her head back to lean on the glass window behind her, she glanced at the hordes of taxis heading down the avenue. There was a rhythmic elegance to the way that they stopped and started that transfixed her. Everything was working as it was supposed to be, everyone chugged along and none of it mattered. Back when they left their apartment, they’d considered joining the ranks on the road, but a need for wine drove her elsewhere.

Claire chuckled to herself. Didn’t it always? There was still a chance that it still could, if only she could get past all this rain.

As she started rummaging around in her bag for her umbrella, Claire felt her phone start going off in her pocket. She stopped searching and pulled it out.

Please be Beth. Please be Beth.

Both the skies and the gods themselves continue to spit down on her: it was Him.

This time, she picked up the phone. She wasn’t listening to what he said, but the message was already clear: she wasn’t to blame and, although he’d find it difficult, there wasn’t anyhing they couldn’t make it through. Pressing her phone between her head and her shoulder, she continued rummaging through her bag; if she could only get to the wine, then it all wouldn’t be so bleak.

She found it. She rose to her feet, opening the umbrella and started to raise it above her head. The voice droned on in her ear but she found herself oddly detached from the situation. She could still make it to the party, albeit extraordinarily late, and attempt to salvage something from the night.

Her dress and her make-up was ruined but, hey, she still had that bottle of wine. Her shoes weren’t that wet. She put the half-cocked umbrella down next to her and took the phone firmly in her hand. She cut in over his barrage.

“Thank you. But no. Not now.”

She stepped out into the rain.
