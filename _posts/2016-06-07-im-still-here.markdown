The sun was beaming down on the boat, life was heating up, but they weren’t going anywhere.

It was the most comfortable that either of them had been in weeks. Tunger had been keeping the shop open for longer and longer hours and lines were starting to show on his round, red face. With a fishing rod in his hand and his daughter by his side, he was finally content; that only made what he had to do all the harder.

Quinn looked up at her father and, seeing the beginnings of a smile vanish, knew that everything was about to change. Convincing herself to climb into this boat had been a tremendous challenge and she was starting to think that she’d made the wrong decision. None of this could happen if she’d decided to simply not show up.

It all began with a sigh.

Years from now, when Quinn would look back on this moment, she would remember that sound of true resignation.

“Listen Quinny,” Tunger began. “You’re going to have to go away for a little while”. Even with her foreknowledge of the situation, the words still stung. “Those people that came by the other day brought something that I think you should see. I don’t know what it is, but they said that we needed to let you open it yourself.”

Tunger unfurled a slightly crumpled, but still noticeably well decorated, envelope from his pocket, and, with only a slight moment’s hesitation, handed it over.

Despite herself, Quinn’s breath caught when she saw the envelope. Taking it gingerly in her hand with a sudden, but all-consuming, reverence, she looked at the front for her own name. There must have been a mistake; they couldn’t have really chosen her. Written in a smooth, yet confident, cursive was her full name: Barquin Bracken. Turning it back over, she looked for a way in.

“They said that you’d know what to do to open it,” Tunger prompted. “That if it was meant for you then you’d know what to do now.”

Quinn looked at it blankly. This insignificant object that had prompted so much change in her life needed to test her? This wasn’t even something that she was sure that she wanted; why would she even try to open it. She looked back at her father pleadingly. With a wan smile, he met her eye. Glancing down at the envelope and then back up at her, all he had to offer was a simple prompting: “You might as well try”.

Reluctantly, Quinn closed her eyes, hands still clutching the ornate stationery. Her entire mind impulsively reached out towards the object in her hands. She could sense a weak enchantment surrounding it; it felt familiar, but still somehow alien to her.

As she’d been taught, Quinn split off the part of her mind that dealt best with the creation of counter-spells and set it to work. This was the part of the process that she’d always struggled with: the large spells were easy; it was the intricate ones that tripped her up. Quinn found herself getting drawn in deeper and deeper into the spell. She could tell that something was about to happen; she just hoped that it was the right thing.

Simultaneously sparking and spluttering, power burst from Quinn’s eyes and spiralled up above them. As the boat swayed violently from side to side, Tunger reached out a calming hand.

“Hey,” he soothed. “It’s alright. Just try again.” Throwing the letter to the floor of the boat, Quinn stood violently.

“All of this is pointless anyway,” she shot back. “I don’t even want to go. I’m not even good enough to pass their stupid fu-”.

“Don’t you dare. We won’t have you representing the Bracken clan with a mouth like that. It’s just a small test. Sit down.” Tunger scolded. “Just. Try. Again.” The boat continued to rock in silence as Quinn took stock of her situation.

“Fine,” she harumphed as she took her place, staring intently at a knot of wood in the seat in front of her. The boat had calmed itself before she spoke again.

“This is too hard and I’m not even good enough to get in” she moaned. Watching his daughter making an arch-nemesis of this piece of wood, Tunger had never been more sure of her abilities and her drive. Nobody lived life with such an intent passion as she. He placed a broad hand on her tiny shoulder. His voice was low and soft.

“I’m here,” he said. “I’m still here.”

Instinctively sighing, Quinn picked up the envelope again and closed her eyes. Again, her mind reached out and again her mind split apart. This time, it was easy. Her mind sped across the outline of the envelope, darting within all of the little imperfections and knicks. She received brief impressions of everyone that had touched it; a crotchety old delivery man carrying bundles of them for miles; a wise, bearded warlock signing the front with his favourite quill; her father clutching it, knowing that it was a dark harbinger. There. That was what she needed.

With a noise that he could only describe as a click, Tunger saw the envelope leap up into the air. At the apex of its jump, two meters above their head, it spat out a spiral of green fire into the air. The pair gasped.

As they watched it drift back down, the outer envelope dissolved, revealing a magical notice within. Snatching it out of midair, Quinn eyes darted across it. Squeezing past her, Tunger re-took his seat at the fore of the boat and checked that his line was still intact.

“They want me to start next week!” she exclaimed. “I’m in the scarab class!” Pausing, she lowered the letter. “I don’t know if I should be grateful or insulted."

Reeling in his line slightly to remove some of the slack that had gathered, Tunger began to talk.

“You know we’ll need to make sure that…” he began, turning his head as he spoke. He was interrupted mid-stream by a running hug from his daughter. Not many people could so easily wind a man like him, but she always seemed to managed it.

“Thanks,” she whispered.

“I didn’t do anything,” he countered. As the sun beamed down on them, they stood there in silence for a moment.

Then, suddenly, the fishing line twitched.
