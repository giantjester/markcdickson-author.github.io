My doorbell doesn't work.

I recently moved houses with my boyfriend and we recently found out that the doorbell doesn't work. You might not think that this sounds like a big deal; you can put a handwritten little sign on the door saying “The doorbell doesn't work. Please knock loudly” and the problem's solved. The solution is pedestrian.

However, when you first move into a house, everything seems to go wrong. Tensions are high. It really tests the strength of your relationships to your partner and you learn a lot about how you both react in high tension situations.

There was something about this faulty doorbell that really pushed us to extremes. You miss deliveries of furniture; you can't fully unpack. It all starts to wear on you. Sometimes a little too much.

That's when we realised that the front door didn't seem to lock correctly. We'd go to sleep at night, set the alarm and come downstairs to find that the alarm was still set, but the door was unlocked. Both of us swore that we'd locked the door when we came in and argued for a few days when it kept happening to us.

One of us was leaving the door unlocked, putting all of the things that we had yet to unpack at risk and it was driving us both up the wall. We both resolved to double check the door at night and the problem disappeared. Both of us getting involved fixed the problem and teamed us up against this door that was conspiring against us.

I took some time off for work to move all of things over into our new house. When I went back to work, he'd stay and home and continue to unpack the house. He'd put things in the wrong place. Plates would be stored in the living room, requiring you to walk back and forth when you were cooking.

He'd insist that it was because we didn't have the room in the kitchen; I disagreed and we fought again. At the end of the day, I agreed to let him have his way. It bothered me, but I let it go. We'd have to spend a much larger proportion of our time unnecessarily moving around the house, but it was fine. It's fine; it still bothered me.

The next thing that happened is something that happens to everyone when you move into a new house: it makes strange noises that you aren't used to. Floorboards will creak at odd times and you can swear that you hear somebody else in the house. Shadows fall across the furniture in weird ways that you don't expect, making you fear for your life for a split second.

You don't notice them all at once, so it takes you a while to fully feel comfortable in a new house. Normally, it's when you have that first frightful moment at night and emerge from the other end unscathed. It was similar for us, but there was a significant and disturbing deviation from the norm.

Shortly after all of our furniture was set up and those plates were put in the wrong place, we had that night where you both wake up terrified. We both heard something move in the house and woke up, looking at each other. This wasn't our first time living together; we'd been through this before. Being the coward that I am, I stayed sat up in bed, hand grasping my phone while he went and looked around the house.

As I was used to a small flat, I expected him to return momentarily but, when he didn't, I began to get worried. I called out to him once. He didn't respond. Again. No response. I decided, for once, to deviate from our agreed upon routine and left the bed, with one eye squeezed shut; after all, I didn't want to wake up too much.

There was a light on downstairs in the living room. I wandered down to him and found him staring dumbfounded at a pile of shattered plates on the floor. The shelf that they were on had buckled slightly and was tilted down at the ground; it was clear that this wasn't actually a problem.

He kept going on and on and on about how we needed to be sure that there wasn't somebody else in the house. It was clear that there wasn't; the crappy shelf had just broken. Despite this, we checked all of the windows and doors and found them all intact and locked. I was right. As always.

The next day, I can remember how exhausted I was. Even with one eye closed, I'd found it far too hard to get back to sleep afterwards. I'd fallen asleep some time after 3am and had woken up at 5am to be able to get to my job on time; commuting so far every day was a pain, but at least the pay was good. Well, it was good for one person. It didn't really stretch far enough to cover two people; but somehow I was forced to make it work.

We'd had contents insurance, even accidental, in our old flat but hadn't had chance yet to transfer our policy over to our new house. Therefore, because I was the one with the job, I had to go and shell out the money for the new plates. Even though I didn't want to put them there. Purely because, and I quote, “You're the one with the income”. I understand that. Honestly, I do. It still bothered me.

This was a one-off for a while but, as the weeks continued to pass, they unfortunately became something of a regular occurrence. There often wasn't a noticeable cause, but he'd claim to hear someone moving in the house or something falling down and have to go and check it out, leaving me at my constant vigil by the phone. More often that not, he'd come back with nothing and we'd have to chalk it up to tiredness and paranoia. Once in a while though, something would have changed. At least he'd claim it had.

It was never anything that I could see. A cabinet moved slightly out of place; the washing hamper knocked all over the floor. Every time he found something like this, he'd drag me out of bed to see it and, as a result, I'd sleep less. Over and over again.

It was starting to drive me a little bit crazy. My work performance started to degrade because I was finding myself so tired all the time. My boss had to actually call a meeting to talk about it and I was told in no uncertain terms that if I didn't start to come to work in a better state, then I was going to lose my job.

Then the thing with the door started to happen again. We'd both go to bed, with the alarm set and wake up to find the door unlocked. All of stuff was unpacked and put away now, but it was still a ridiculous hazard to all of our things. He, of course, continued to insist that he hadn't done it, but I knew that it had to be him.

It wasn't me and, unless some other presence had taken up resident in our property, he was the only one left. It kept happening and honestly, it really and completely bothered me. I'd worry about it at work. I'd worry about it at night. And there he was; still doing it.

Then that final bad day at work happened. I used to be on good terms with my boss before all of this started and now I'd finally missed a serious deadline. People were starting to complain about my behaviour and my inability to successfully work with anyone without having some form of outburst. Honestly, it was all overplayed. I calmly explained my situation at home, but he kept repeating how the company understood and sympathised, but couldn't do anything about it if I wasn't able to finish my work on time. So I quit.

I came home from work that afternoon in a suitably foul mood. I suggested that we go out to celebrate with my last paycheck, but was met with an onslaught of negativity about how we couldn't afford it and how we needed to save money for the future.

It was partly his money after all and he deserved a say in how it was spent. It was what kept him afloat and allowed him to pursue his dreams. His dreams. Not our dreams. His dreams. I told him that he could go fuck himself and headed out for a drive on my own.

A scream resonated throughout the house that night. He must have woken up in that same terrified state that we'd become so used too. Unfortunately, this time it was a voice that he recognised. I heard him sprinting down the stairs towards the source of the noise and knew that it was all going to be over soon. I was already down there. He saw me there. I saw him. Then it was all over.

The plates don't bother me much anymore.

The door doesn't bother much anymore.

And the doorbell definitely doesn't really worry me anymore.
