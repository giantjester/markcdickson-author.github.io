The room was dark and Spade couldn’t keep his eyes off her. The way that her hair reflected the moonlight and how she stood there in her red dress, so absolutely, so confidently, waiting for him to speak.

He thought back to the moment that they’d met and how instantly smitten he’d been with her; even though he saw people of her calibre on a weekly basis, there was something special about her. Spade took a step closer to her and opened his mouth to speak. How much of what she’d said to him was true? There was no way of knowing. Despite all of his skills and all of his experience, he was still entirely unable to read her.

The first case that Spade had ever taken had had somebody like this: someone that outwardly projected one image but was working furiously on cultivating another one below the surface. The moment that Spade had turned his head, another visage had appeared before him; the perp jumping from traumatised victim to conspiring mastermind the next. Spade had caught that perpetrator in the act and he knew that he could do it here. He started mentally listing off everything that he knew about her.

Cindy carried herself with all of the elegance of someone who’d been raised surrounded by unimaginable wealth, but there were moments when Spade thought he saw that facade start to slip, potentially hampered by the lack of self-belief that you instinctively obtain when you grow up poor. The way that she’d relentlessly through herself at him, at everyone, through this case also had two dichotomous interpretations that he couldn’t choose between.

One option was that she’d been forced to grow up too drastically, too quickly, in world where every day is another struggle to obtain your basic means. On other other hand, it was perfectly possible that she'd been taught by an esteemed mother that, ultimately, this was a man’s world and that she’d have to force her way through to get by. There wasn’t a single thing about her that he was sure about and that’s where his usually quick intuition kept getting stuck.

She took a step closer to him, pressing her scarlet lips and her lithe body against his and he felt himself impulsively falling into her embrace. The way that she smelled, the way that she made him feel, surely all of that was real; he kept telling himself that wouldn’t ever fall for this act again. He wasn’t the naive sap that he’d been twenty years ago; he could smell an overcompensation a mile away. Or could he? Spade pushed her away from him, keeping her at arm’s length.

“No,” he muttered.

He saw Cindy tried to wriggle free from his grasp, leaning closer towards him, using the entirety of her body weight to get closer to his.

“Come on, Spade,” she slurred. “You know me.” The scent of her perfume smacked Spade in the face as she got closer and he was again immediately sent back to the first time that they’d met. She’d been wearing this very dress and he’d told her that he loved the way that it asymmetrically hung from her shoulder; they had talked deep into the night, moving gradually from bar to bar.

But then immediately the next day, Spade had found her in the clutches of the very person that he’d been chasing after. That same person now sat alone behind bars; perhaps the perp deserved to be reunited with his beautiful companion. For all that Spade had seen Cindy do over the course of this case, along with all of the evidence that would likely surface over the next few days, he had ample cause to bring her in for, at the very least, a thorough investigation.

“Do I though?” Spade snapped back. “And, even if I did, is that truly enough to get us by? To keep us going long into our old age?” Spade saw Cindy’s face immediately fall, rehearsed in its sincerity and she took a step backwards as if struck.

“Spade,” she began, clutching her hands to her chest. “I’ve let you in further than I’ve ever let anyone else before; you saved me from him.We understand each other and we wholly and irrevocably gave ourselves to each other. I fell in love with you that night.” Cindy took a step closer to him and struck a very familiar pose, one hand on her left hip and the other hung over her chest, wrist falling limp. “I know that you still think of that night. I know that I do.”

That night had undoubtedly been one of the very best of his life. The way that they’d fit together, the simple, but elegant, way that their bodies had meshed had pushed all other thoughts from his mind at the time and continued to do so now. Spade looked at her, standing there so perfectly shaped, curves filling the dress at all levels, and knew that he needed to make a decision before she touched him again. Another moment like that and Spade knew that he’d fall so absolutely for her that he’d never be able to escape.

“All we’ve got is the fact that maybe you love me and maybe I love you,” he mused. Cindy took a step closer to him, reaching out her hand.

“You know,” she whispered. “Whether you do or not”. Spade found himself instinctively stepping backwards, raising an open palm towards her.

“I don’t,” he countered. “It’s easy enough to be nuts about you, but I don’t know what that amounts to. Does anybody ever? Suppose I do, whatever, maybe next month I won’t. I’ve been through it before when it lasted that long, but then what?” She looked at him silently, impulsively pouting her lips.

“Whatever you want,” she purred.

Spade shook his head, slowly at first, but gradually growing in amplitude as he stared at her.

“It’s too late,” he grumbled. “Far, far too late.” Cindy began to shake her head in response.

“No...no, no, no, no,” she began to murmur, tears welling in her gorgeous brown eyes. Spade turned on his heel and strode out of the room. He heard her audibly collapse to the floor behind him. As Spade reached the doorway, he turned around and looked at her.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “You have no idea how much.”
