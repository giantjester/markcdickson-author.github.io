The classroom was cold today. Julie walked over to her desk and let her bags fall heavily onto the floor before turning and walking towards the thermostat.

“Nineteen?!” she muttered under her breath. “Jesus Christ.” She turned the dial up to a balmy 25 degrees and then turned to face the classroom for the day.

Julie had left it in a reasonable state the night before, making sure to put the majority of the textbooks away, but there was still a little bit more to do to get everything ready for the day. The wide windows covered the entirety of the wall facing her; the sunlight had yet to creep into the day so Julie found herself staring at an unkempt reflection. She smoothed her hair down quickly and retucked her shirt into her trousers.

Julie glanced at her watch. There was just enough time, but she’d have to be quick.

Darting back over to the front of the room, Julie picked up her bags from the floor and placed them far more gently on the desk. The bag full of half-marked books unbalanced itself and fell to one side; she caught it before it slipped completely off the desk. Reaching inside, Julie pulled the pile of books out and placed them in a neat pile in front of her chair. Those would have to wait until everything else was sorted.

Calculators. She needed calculators. Julie spun and began to walk out of the room, cursing herself for not having filled out the request yesterday. She found herself willing Beverly to be in a kind and giving mood; catch her on the wrong day and you’d leave thanking her for withholding materials from you. Midway through the door frame, Julie stopped.

Beverly didn’t get into school for another hour; apparent “doctor’s orders” prevented her from getting less than her prescribed amount of sleep. Julie sighed and pushed her dangling fringe out of her eyes. Her mind felt sluggish this morning and it was taking her a lot longer to piece together what she had to do. That was when it hit her: coffee. A steaming hot pot of coffee was exactly what she needed. None of that instant crap, mind you; the proper stuff. Julie found herself wondering if she had any of that Vietnamese coffee left.

But first, she needed to get some sort message to the guardian of resources. Twisting around, Julie strode to her handbag that lay on the floor where she’d dropped it and pulled out her phone. Swiping her index finger across the screen, Julie unlocked it and began to look through her contacts. She didn’t have Beverly’s number. Who would be the best to deal with the woman at this hour?

Lawrence Bradley would probably be the best bet. He was in the classroom on the very front of the school and would see Beverly arrive either through the window or the door into the hallway.

Julie scrolled down to his name in her contacts and began to type out a text to him. She thought that they got on well enough; they were work friends at the very least. Lawrence had been her co-chaperone at the most recent school disco and they’d discovered a mutual love of cheesy power ballads; her’s came from the 80s, where he was more a fan of the 1990s. They’d been appending their correspondance with random lyrics every since.

“Please send Bevvy my way when she comes in” Julie wrote. “I need something from her, but forgot to fill out a form yesterday. I hope she’s in a good mood!” She paused for a second, trying to think of the right lyrics to add; she decided that Aerosmith would have to do. “I don’t wanna miss a thing with my lesson today.”

Julie sent the text, put her phone down on the desk and started to look around the room, feeling slightly dazed.

What was she doing?

Coffee.

Sat at her desk ten minutes later, Julie relaxed into her mug of Trung Nguyen, savouring the chocolate undertones that she convinced herself that she could taste. Taking a long drink, she exhaled deeply and leaned back in her chair that, even though the reclining mechanism was long dilapidated, supported her the best that it could.

Wait; what time was it?

Julie bolted upright and slammed her mug down on the desk. A wave of coffee rocked over the lip of the mug and splattered onto the table. Cursing slightly, Julie began to gently move the pile of workbooks away from the spill before wiping it with one of the tissues from her pocket. Pushing her chair away from the desk, Julie grabbed the mug.

Downing as much as quickly as possible, she began to stride over towards the classroom sink. The sudden heat of the liquid surprised her and she flinched, spilling a few drops down the front of her jacket. Angrily muttering under her breath, Julie poured the rest of the coffee into the plughole and rinsed the mug before putting it to one side.

Tidying needed to be finished first; marking the books would have to fit in somewhere later. Darting around the room, Julie picked up the few remaining pens and books from wherever they had fallen. She blindly shoved the books back onto the shelves as she strode past them. Alphabetisation would have to stand and wait in the corner; there simply wasn’t time for its nonsense today.

A voice rang in from the hallway, giving Julie a bit of a fright. “Julie? Are you in yet?”

Dropping the pens haphazardly into the pen-pot near the window, Julie responded with a curt affirmation before jogging through her door into the hallway. It was Beverly in early, for the second time this week, bravely acting against her “doctor’s wishes”. She was clutching her infamous red clipboard in both hands.

“Yes, Beverly,” Julie said breathlessly. “Sorry about taking so long. Did you want something?”

Beverly narrowed her eyes.

“Lawrence was told that you wanted me,” she breathed. Beverly was a woman with a presence whenever she walked into a room. Not necessarily one that you would like to describe, or one that you ever really desired, but it was prominent nonetheless. As Julie stared up at her, she cursed herself internally for her brain making the fumble. Clearly the coffee hadn’t quite kicked in yet.

“Right, yes, sorry,” Julie fumbled. She straightened herself up. “I need some calculators for my lesson later and I need you to…”

“That’s funny,” Beverly interrupted, glancing down at the board in her hand. “I don’t think I have a request form from you for today.” She flicked the front piece of paper up and looked beneath it. “I don’t even have one from you for tomorrow.” Julie watched Beverly raise her eyes again to meet hers. There was a moment of silence.

The way that Beverly talked to her always reminded Julie of her mother’s approach to discipline: passive aggressive and yet simultaneously intensely aggressive. Most parents would directly raise the issue that they have with their child and attempt to work through it, but Julie’s mother would only ever hand you the rope and then see what you did with it. There was a red ledger full of supposed favours and acts of mercy that Julie was always struggling fruitlessly to clear.

There was one particular night that Julie always flashed back to. She’d come home with some maths homework that was, as it had seemed at the time, insurmountable; she couldn’t have been more than eight at the time. After attempting to manoeuvre through it for the best part of an hour, she’d gone up to her mother and asked for help with some mathematic theory that she could no longer remember the particulars of.

Her mother had been strewn across the sofa, draped over her newest conquest, news on the TV in the background but not actually being watched. Julie had walked directly up to her mother with her work, close to tears with frustration at this point, and had asked extraordinarily sweetly for a bit of a nudge in the right direction.

“What are you comin’ in here yammering on about?” her mother had said absent-mindedly, not taking her eyes or hands off the man next to her.

“I can’t do this work, Mum” Julie had blubbered. “I’m so stupid.” She’d collapsed onto the floor in the living room, accidentally crumpling the piece of paper that she’d been holding. It was at this point that her mother realised that Julie wasn’t going to be leaving on her own any time soon. Sighing deeply, her mother had unclasped herself and pushed herself off the sofa.

“You raise a stupid child, you get stupid questions,” her mother had muttered under her breath. She’d roughly stuck a hand in each of Julie’s armpits and pulled her to her feet. Julie had looked up at her mother, tears still freely streaming down her face, waiting for a word of comfort, a sign that this was coming from a place of love instead of one of obligation.

“Show me what you’re looking at,” her mother had ordered. “Let’s get this over with.” Grabbing Julie’s hand, her mother had yanked her out of living room and into the kitchen.

Despite everything that her mother had put her through, Julie retroactively credited this incident with the moment at which she’d decided to become a teacher. Through all of those long nights studying at university and feeling the weight of her dreams pulling desperately against her bank account, she’d told herself that no child should ever have to feel this way; under her watch, there truly was going to be no child left behind.

Julie felt this pent-up rage bubbling beneath the surface, desperately trying to get a foothold. She felt her fists tighten as she stared up into Beverly’s unwaveringly smug face. And then, as she took a deep breath in through her nose, it all went away.

“Yeah. I’m sorry about that Beverly,” Julie said sweetly. “Can you make an exception for me this time please?” She paused for a second before smiling at Beverly. “I’ll bring you in a muffin tomorrow morning for breakfast,” she offered. There was another moment of silence before Beverly nodded.

“I’ll make an exception, just this once,” Beverly conceded, “but you need to make sure that you don’t do it again.”

“I promise,” Julie said, raising three fingers. “Scout’s honour.” Beverly nodded and produced a satisfied grunt. Julie continued to beam up at her.

“What time do you want them?” Beverly asked, conjuring a pen and lifting the front piece of paper again. Pen poised, she looked back at Julie impatiently.

“Just after lunch would be best,” Julie said. “I need twenty-five if you have them.” After a quick scribble, the piece of paper was smoothed down and the pen was reinstated to its mysterious previous position.

“I’ll see what I can do,” Beverly sighed.

Julie nodded and turned, heading back towards her classroom. She heard Beverly call from behind her.

“I want that muffin tomorrow.”

“You’ve got it, Bevvy.”

“Don’t call me Bevvy.”

Julie smiled to herself as she walked away.

As she passed through the doorway, already mentally deciding which of the local shops sold the best muffins, she noticed that she could no longer see her own reflection in the room’s window; the sun was already beginning to rise. Cursing under her breath, Julie rushed over to her desk and began to unpack her second bag.

Today was the day that Julie had planned something of a murder mystery for her class. It was something that she’d been attempting to arrange for a long time, children learn best when they’re actively engaged after all, but it had only been the impending OFSTED inspection that had spurred Mr Holt, the headteacher, to approve her lesson plan. Today was the trial run; if something of this scale could be proven to work, she could work on making it bigger and better.

All of her clues: chalk for the “body outline” on the floor, yellow tape with the startling message “POLICE LINE. DO NOT CROSS” written across it. It was all here. Julie had spent most of the weekend working through the logistics of today. Most of it had been alone, but she’d brought in her young son to test the waters.

Despite the long hours that this job forced her to keep, Julie couldn’t help but think that it had brought her closer to her son in moments like this. He had an energy and an enthusiasm for creation that allowed him to not only iron out the creases in her plans, but to brainstorm alongside her. The weekends when he would sit with her in their living room, helping her to fit the pieces of everything together, were really special to her. The only thing that she wished for was that he would be able to take the day off school and come and act it out with her.

Last night, just before she’d had to send him up to bed, he’d played the part of the policeman who was presenting the evidence that he’d discovered so far. The entire time, he’d been trying to create this gruff, stoic, and apparently American, character.

Julie stopped unpacking for a second and smiled to herself.

He’d never been able to do accents; whatever he’d been trying to do came out as some bizarre jumble of Japanese and Indian. It had made her laugh so immediately and so intensely that he’d carried it on until she’d closed the door to his bedroom an hour later.

That reminded her: she needed to have a talk to her husband about that accent. It might not have come from him, but it probably came from his parents. She knew that there would be a degree of plausible deniability involved on his side of the conversation, but they needed to nip it in the bud before he actually did that accent in public and got the whole lot of them into trouble.

Shaking her head, grinning beatifically, Julie took the last item out of the bag and placed it in a pile with the rest. She glanced at her watch. There was about half an hour until the kids would start rolling in for the day; plenty of time.

Turning to her room, she saw the desks neatly arranged in their parallel rows and columns and knew that she had a lot to do. Interlacing the fingers of both hands, she pushed her palms away from her, cracking her knuckles with a satisfying clunk. This was going to be the best goddamn lesson she’d ever done; she just knew it.
