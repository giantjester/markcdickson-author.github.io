“Open!” Dani yelled. The bricks beside her shimmered before melting away into a large circle. She kept herself pressed up against the wall as she looked side to side, checking if the coast was clear, before pivoting on one foot to poke her head briefly through the now translucent wall.

“We’re clear,” she yelled. “Move up on my position.” Dani took a step through the portal, pointing her golden bow down both ends of the corridor, and rushed to press her back against the next wall. She held the fletching on the arrow tightly, ready to release, continuing to dart her gaze from side to side.

“Where the bloody hell are you guys?!” she screamed.

A helmeted man in light chainmail rushed around the corner nearest her tightly clutching a two-handed sword, so she turned and loosed the arrow. It struck true, sending the soldier flying back into the wall; he hung there limp, but ultimately well.

When she’d asked Zeus to supply them for the fight, she’d known that she hadn’t wanted to slaughter the entire castle; a large proportion of them would simply be following orders. The arrows in her quiver matched those which she’d been using that morning, but lacked the ability to control minds. Zeus had said that he wouldn’t have known how.

Dani caught a glimpse of distant movement out of the corner of her eye and she whirled, grabbing an arrow from the quiver that hung on her hip and knocking it. Two soldiers had appeared at the other end of the corridor.

One bore a sword and shield; the other had a weapon to match hers. The one with the bow knelt and began to reach for an arrow, while the shielded one began to charge. Dani loosed an arrow at him, but it bounced off the shield of the incoming enemy. She began to back down the hallway, grasping at her belt.

With a roar that echoed down the hallway, a blur of motion came charging in through the gaping hole in the wall. Light bounced off the platemail into the eyes of the soldiers, throwing them slightly off-balance. Dani breathed a sigh of relief, followed immediately by a swelling rage.

“Where the bloody hell have you been?” she cussed, using the respite to back into the nearest wall and draw another arrow. The new warrior parried an incoming blow from the soldier with the sword in their left hand before striking back with the sword in their right. The castle’s soldier immediately froze, skin unbroken, before falling gently to one side.

Dani pushed herself away from the wall and fired at the opposing archer, piercing the armour and adding another decoration to the wall. Breathing out deeply, she got another arrow ready, but walked over to the warrior.

“Sorry, mother,” the warrior said, relaxing their posture slightly and turning around smirking. “Looks like I got here just in time.” Dani tutted.

“Where’s your father?” she asked brusquely. The warrior looked back over their shoulder through the portal.

“He was right behind me.”

A new throng of soldiers came barrelling around the corner, halting their conversation mid-flow.

“You got these?” Dani asked, turning towards the portal. The warrior slashed both swords down in front of them before responding curtly.

“Of course.”

Dani poked her head back through the gap, looking both ways down the corridor that they'd just left. At the end of the long corridor, she could see Dec facing off against two assailants and stepped one leg through the portal, readying her bow. As Dec turned to face one of them, striking down with his two-handed sword, he left his flank exposed.

Dani took a deep breath and held it, looking down the shaft of the arrow. As Dec struck the soldier on his right, she could see the one on his left stepping in with a horizontal thrust. She let go of the arrow and it flew through the air, this time hitting the enemy in the face.

Dec looked back over his shoulder, grinning, before turning and jogging towards her.

“Sorry,” he mumbled. “I thought I had him.” Dani turned and stepped back into the new corridor, leaning up against the wall alongside the hole as Dec stepped through.

“Close!” she yelled. Where there was once a hole sat the original wall, untouched and unmarred. Dec flinched from her voice.

“Holy Zeus,” he cringed. “Could you wait until I’m further through before screaming in my ear?” Dani grinned, taking a step towards him.

“Maybe don't almost get yourself killed and I won’t have to,” she advised. Dec shook his head, smiling, and reached out a hand to grab hers.

“Can you guys do this later?” a voice called over. “We’re a little busy right now.” The couple turned and saw their child surrounded by a heap of metal, still facing off against one lone survivor. A loud metal on metal clash and a grunt later and their child stood alone.

“We must be getting closer to the centre,” Dani observed. “We’re seeing a much higher concentration of guards.” The warrior walked over to them and nodded. A large metal helmet that matched the plate armour cast their face in shadow; even with the unquestionable weight of it, they carried it effortlessly.

Dani looked around her for a moment, trying to gain her bearings.

“It’s been years since I’ve been in this part of the castle,” she mused. “I don’t know if I can remember which way to go next.” Dec walked up to her and squeezed her hand.

“Can’t you ask Zeus which way it is?” he asked. Dani shook her head silently. She didn’t know how much longer she would have the ability to control him and didn’t want to drain the connection more than absolutely necessary; the portals would have to be enough.

“I think it’s this way,” she concluded, pointing into the bowels of the castle with an arrow. “The large group of troops came from this way.” Before waiting for a response, she began to stride in that direction.

The tapestries, statues and statuettes that adorned the walls as she walked were decadent, but instilled a strange sense of nostalgia in Dani that made her feel uncomfortable. Everything was still the same. Her days in this castle had never been happy ones, but as she walked down these halls she couldn’t help but reminisce.

The party of three strolled down this long corridor and were soon faced with a pair of tremendously large wooden doors. The oak had been carved into the shapes of animals and gods in an attempt to draw the powers of the almighty into guarding the kingdom, topped off by the family crest.

As Dani looked up at it, she flashed back to the last time that she’d seen it: the day that her father had told her that she was going to be taken away. She’d stood there disinterested, making the odd snide remark although, inside, she’d been desperate to cry out for mercy; mercy that he wouldn’t have given even if she’d asked for it. As Dani stood there, she felt Dec come up beside her and grab her left arm, soon combined with the presence of her child on her right. Everything was still the same, but it wouldn’t be for much longer.

Dani wriggled free from Dec's grasp and took a step forward, before turning to face her compatriots behind her.

“Alright,” she snapped. “We need to come up with a plan. He’s going to have an army of soldiers inside there and we need to make sure that we handle this in the best way possible. What do we know?” Dec met her gaze, but looked back at her blankly.

“We can make portals,” he shrugged. Dani pointed an arrow at him, smirking.

“You're not wrong,” she agreed. “What can we do with them?” Dec shrugged his shoulders again and Dani smiled affectionately at him. Dani turned to the warrior on her left.

“Do you have anything?” Dani prompted. There was a moment of silence before the warrior spoke.

“You said that I need to be the one who kills him, right?” they began. Dani nodded.

“If the prophecy is to be believed,” she responded. This was a detail that, despite everything that she’d been through to get here, Dani had tried to push to the back of her mind.

“You have a bow,” the warrior continued. “And you have the ability to make portals.” Dani pointed again at Dec, grinning.

“Which we now know thanks to your dad,” she pointed out. He batted her arrow away, chuckling.

“If we open a portal behind this mad king, then we can get our strike in before he even knows what’s happened,” the warrior concluded. Dani froze. She was unsure whether or not creating a portal at that much distance would release Zeus from her power.

Even though he’d begun the day at an unimaginable power, the limitations imposed on him by the bounds of her control were forcing him to have to stretch himself more and more. This much of a stretch, this late in the day, might be that one nudge too far. Unfortunately, she didn’t see any other way.

“Zeus,” Dani shouted. “I know you’re listening. Do it.” There was a second when the family stood there silently looking at each other before they saw a result, but another gap in reality soon appeared in the wall beside them. They saw the throne room from the pedestal on which the throne stood, the hall spread out before them.

A throng of armed and mailed soldiers stood in formation, shifting uncomfortably, weapons pointed directly at the other side of the large wooden door. The king himself stood to the side of the throne, arms behind his back with one hand grasping the wrist of the other.

None of them wanted to move. Dec turned his head slowly towards Dani and nodded at the warrior standing beside her. Dani nodded and began to gently hand over the bow. Glancing back at her father, she hesitated. She closed her eyes for a second and took a slow, deep breath in.

Exhaling slowly and silently, she handed over the golden weapon to her child. The warrior snatched an arrow from the quiver on her own belt and expertly knocked the arrow. Lining up the shot, the warrior took in a sharp intake of breath and held it. The fletching was released. The arrow whipped past their heads and sunk deep into the neck of its target.

The King clutched at his neck helplessly, gasping for air as his throat opened up from both sides. Reaching a hand out in front of him, he groaned out a harrowingly loud noise, causing the troops below him to spin in anticipation. The King took a step forwards off the plinth and fell heavily onto the step below.

Then another and then another, all the while gasping for air. Then, as The King took a step, he miscalculated, his weight falling out from underneath him. He tumbled down the stairs, comedically flailing his limbs around until his head hit the concrete of the floor with a resounding crack. Before Dani had a chance to process this, she was consumed by a bright flash of white light.

The trio found themselves standing on the green plains outside of the castle. They looked around at each other, blinking in confusion, when a large grey presence began to tower above them.

“I’m free,” it boomed. “You thought you had me, but I’m free.” Storm clouds began to gather overhead as the thunder rolled in. "Free from the confines of your pathetic attempt at a life and free to avenge my containment.” Dani clutched at her belt for a new arrow, only to see that her quiver, along with the rest of each of their arsenal, had disappeared.

“Don’t even bother trying to reach for your weapons; what I conjured forth can just as easily be taken away,” Zeus thundered. “And now, my precious Dani, I’m going to take from you what is rightfully mine.” Dani grabbed the hands of her husband and her child and pulled them close to her.

“Got a plan?” Dec asked timidly. Dani looked up at the true God before her.

“Bugger,” she cursed.
