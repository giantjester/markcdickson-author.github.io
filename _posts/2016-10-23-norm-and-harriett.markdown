**Norm**
========

Norm glanced over his shoulder at his wife in the kitchen and saw her gentle hands squishing the butter and sugar together. She knew that apple crumble was one of his favourites. Norm took a second to appreciate the hard work that she put in, each and every day, to maintain the house.

He considered pushing himself up and walking over to offer a hand, but knew that he’d only be immediately rebuffed. Cooking was one of the ways that she unwound after a tough day; after all, too many cooks spoiled the broth. Norm turned back to the television to see that the football results were just starting to come in and began to scratch the stomach that was poking through the bottom of his cardigan.

“Is everything going OK in there?” Norm yelled. He paused but, not hearing a response, continued anyway. “I can’t wait to see your delicious apples.” He chuckled to himself. It was an inside joke they’d shared for years.

“I hope that they’re big, red and juicy,” he called.

He could hear her tut behind him and smiled to himself. It was a routine that was almost cliché in how rehearsed it was, but it meant far too much to him to ever let it go. Those moments when you realise the intimacy that you have with someone, the knowledge that you'll always be accepted, are the simple moments that you never want to go away.

Less than an hour later, Norm sat with his wife at their ornate, oversized dining table, him chucking back spoonful after spoonful of crumble. After taking a huge mouthful, Norm looked up from his crumble and turned to smile at his wife. He faltered as soon as he saw her. She was idly pushing around her pudding, head lost in some far-off land.

“Is everything alright?” Norm asked, specks of food spraying from his full mouth. He jumped as she threw her spoon into the glass bowl.

“No, Norm. Everything is not bloody alright,” she snapped. “Do you honestly think that everything is alright?” Norm stared blankly at her. “Wipe that food off your face. You look disgusting.” Her chair scraped against the wooden floor as she stood up. Norm leant back in his chair, swallowing as best he could and picked up his napkin to wipe his mouth. He saw his wife stop, look down at the table and take a deep breath.

“I want a divorce,” she whispered.

Norm didn’t know what to say. He lost himself for a moment, breaking eye contact, as he tried to process what he’d just heard. Was this about another man? Had all of that time spent ‘with the girls’ had the ulterior motive that the safety of 40 years of marriage had forced him to ignore?

“Who is he?”

She glanced towards him, without meeting his eye, brow furrowed.

“What on Earth are you talking about?” she muttered. “There’s no-one else.” Norm slammed his napkin down on the table and rose to his feet.

“I don’t believe it,” he yelled. “There’s no way that, after forty bloody years at this that you aren’t leaving me for someone else. Now who is it?” He placed his palms flat on the table and leaned forwards.

“Norm,” she pleaded. “Don’t do this.”

“I’m going to do this until you tell me exactly what’s going on here.”

“There’s nothing going on, I promise you. I’m just not happy.”

“Bullshit,” he shouted, pointing a finger at her. “You were happy ten minutes ago; why wouldn’t you be happy now?”

“Norm, I…” she began.

“You, you, you,” Norm spat. “It’s always about you.” Panting, he fell back into his seat. He wasn't supposed to exert himself like this.

With eyes wide, Norm saw her turn towards him at the sound, finally meeting his eye. She pushed her chair away from the table and shuffled over to him. As she pushed his matted hair out of his eyes, Norm stared up at her, concern radiating from every aspect of her being. There was no way that she was going to leave him; he couldn’t make it on his own.

“Please don’t leave me,” he mumbled.

She pulled his head tightly against her and began stroking what remained of his hair, making hushing noises.

“It’s alright, Norm.” she soothed. “We can talk about this later.”

There was no way that they were going to talk about this later. Norm knew that this whole episode, whatever doubts she may have been harboring, had been placated by the reminder of his frailty and, by extension, hers. They’d grown up together; they needed each other to survive. His need might be the more direct and pressing, but their relationship was a symbiotic one. As she continued to stroke his hair, Norm knew that they’d be together until their dying days.

**Harriett**
============

Another day, another dinner. Chopping and dicing and peeling and boiling. Dicing and boiling and peeling and chopping. Tonight, it was apple crumble; that meant apples, apples and more apples.

Over the years, Harriett had become accustomed to their way of life. Norm had been retired from the taxi service for about six years and, over that time, had managed to successfully grow an entire sofa out of his rear end. He’d been attached to that thing due to his “war injuries”, despite any doctor’s visit to the contrary, and had subsequently checked out of any significant contribution to their marriage.

Harriett put down the apple that she’d been peeling and took a step back from the counter. Deep breath in through her nose. Deep breath out through her mouth. It had been a tough couple of weeks; she hadn’t meant to ruminate on her life with Norm. All-in-all, it had been pretty great. He’d given her three wonderful kids, all of whom had since found their own partners, and he really had done the best that he could.

“Is everything going OK in there?” Norm bellowed from the living room. Harriett heard the impatient undertones in his words and bristled. She turned away from the half-peeled fruit on the counter and began to snap back at him. Harriett caught her tongue, determined to let the night be happy.

Despite everything that Norm had given her, Harriett did wish that gratitude was part of it. Platitudes were something that you were taught at a very young age that unfortunately, she thought, faded with familiarity. She’d found herself unable to distinguish between his genuine gratefulness and the rehearsed lines that he spouted to avoid her scalding. As long as he didn’t carry on that heinous joke, she’d be alright. Had he spotted what she’d been making? Harriett thought it unlikely; the football results were on.

“I can’t wait to see your delicious apples,” Norm continued, relentless. “I hope that they’re big, red and juicy.” Instinctively, Harriett found herself tutting. It had been an inside joke for years that was so far beyond cliché, it had almost cycled back around to entertaining. Almost. Harriett narrated in a whisper as she completed another round of her beathing exercise.

“Deep breath in through the nose. Deep breath out through the mouth.”

The way that he ate took Harriett by surprise every night. The day when she finally thought that she’d seen all of the ways that a spoon could fit into a face, Norm would surprise her. Harriett sat there next to it all, day-in and day-out, desperately trying to keep her eyes on her own food, pretending that those noises were sewage getting caught in the pipes overhead. It was more pleasant that way.

Tonight however, Harriett found herself looking at the empty chairs at their dining table. Each stood as an effigy to a fleeting childhood, reminding her that she’d failed to truly pay attention, to appreciate each and every tantrum, before it was over. She found herself turning to smile at Norm, remembering a certain “Mashed Potato Incident”, and caught him just as he was drinking directly from the jug of custard. Harriett sighed deeply and turned back to her bowl.

There truly was nothing left of the man that she’d married.

Harriett’s reaction had spurred some instinctive reaction in Norm and he finally snapped out of the rabid food frenzy that he’d found himself in. He saw her idly pushing around her pudding, head lost in some far-off land.

“Is everything alright?” Norm asked, specks of food spraying from his full mouth. He jumped as she threw her spoon into the glass bowl.

“No, Norm. Everything is not bloody alright,” Harriett snapped. “Do you honestly think that everything is alright?” Norm stared blankly at her. “Wipe that food off your face. You look disgusting.” Harriett deliberately scraped her chair against the wooden floor as she stood up, trying to just make a noise. Norm leant back in his chair, food dribbling down his chin as he reached for a napkin. He saw his wife stop, look down at the table and take a deep breath.

“I want a divorce,” she whispered.

Harriett heard a sharp intake of breath. She turned to see him staring down towards the table, napkin clutched tightly in his hand, eyes unable to focus on anything. What was he thinking? Would he feel the same way too? Harriett began to fiddle with the front of her blouse, keeping her eyes firmly locked on his face. Would he try to fight for her?

“Who is he?” he asked, snapping his eyes back into focus. Harriett turned away and sighed, shaking her head. If he wanted to throw forty years of marriage down the drain like this, then she was willing to tango. Everything that she’d been through in recent years, his sense of apathy and complacency, bubbled to the surface. If he wanted this process to be acrimonious, then that was perfectly fine with her.

“What on Earth are you talking about?” she muttered. “There’s no-one else.” Norm slammed his napkin down on the table and rose to his feet too. Harriett flinched at the sound, but refused to take a step back.

“I don’t believe it.” he yelled. “There’s no way that, after forty bloody years at this that you aren’t leaving me for someone else. Now who is it?” He placed his palms flat on the table and leaned forwards. This was a side of him that Harriett hadn’t seen since they’d been dating; it was a part that she thought she’d conditioned out of him.

“Norm,” she commanded. “Don’t do this.”

“I’m going to do this until you tell me exactly what’s going on here.”

“There’s nothing going on, I promise you. I’m not happy.”

“Bullshit.” he shouted, pointing a finger at her. “You were happy ten minutes ago; why wouldn’t you be happy now?”

“Norm, I…” she began.

“You, you, you,” Norm spat. “It’s always about you.” Panting, he fell back into his seat. Harriett began to panic. Not this; not now. Despite everything that that had been said, the decision that she’d come to, she knew that she couldn’t live with herself if she left him alone while he was in this state.

Harriett pushed her chair away from the table and shuffled over to him. As she pushed his matted hair out of his eyes, Norm stared up at her, eyes wide. This was when she realised that there was never going to be a right time to do this, not at this point in life. If she wanted to get out, she needed to do it tonight.

“Please don’t leave me,” he mumbled.

Harriett pulled his head tightly against her and began stroking what remained of his hair, making hushing noises. There were options that she could utilise. His sister lived a few roads down and, despite all of the words that had passed between the two of them over the years, Harriett knew that his sister would come at the drop of a hat. Norm needed care, but it didn’t matter who it came from.

“It’s alright, Norm.” she soothed. “We can talk about this later.”

It would take fifteen minutes to get him upstairs and tucked into bed; then she could call his sister and come up with some excuse for why she needed to come over. That would take a couple of minutes at most. As his sister came over, Harriett knew that she could pack a bag pretty quickly. Perhaps another ten minutes. As long as she made the first step tonight, all of the rest would come far easier later.

Harriett looked at the clock. They’d had a late dinner, so it was nearing 7:30 at this point. They’d been married for forty years and, although their marriage had been a long time in the breaking, Harriett couldn’t quite believe that it was all going to unravel by the time the clock struck eight.
