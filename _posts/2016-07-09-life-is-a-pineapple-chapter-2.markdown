The absurdity of the situation struck her directly in the face.

“Wait, what?” Cerise chuckled, surprising even herself. “You’re called the Spirali…?” She burst into manic laughter that kept growing in waves as she relived what he’d just said. Gasping for breath, she quickly heard herself with a pressing question.

“You named yourself after a stupid piece of kitchen equipment that makes fucking vegetable spaghetti?”

The exponential growth of her laughter halted as she realised what effect she was having on the man stood in front of her. His face had set as he glowered down at her.

“You fucking dare…?” he spat, leaning his face in towards hers. “I brought you here and…”

Interrupting himself mid-sentence, The Spiraliser looked down at the floor and took a deep breath. He pushed off the floor and stepped back away from the centre of the room. Sporadically rocking his head from side to side, he began to pace, muttering to himself.

“She doesn’t even appreciate that you…”

“Well why would she when you haven’t even…?”

“I should just go and tell her what…”

“This is all his fault.”

“Well of course it’s his fault…”

Watching this unfold in front of her, Cerise stared in abject horror. Had she pushed him too far? Was she being ungrateful? Without the wealth of knowledge that he appeared to be working from, it was extraordinarily difficult for her to tell. Snapping out of this reverie, she used this respite to again look around the room they were in.

The boards were still in place over the windows, nails sticking out at odd angles, but there still wasn’t a sign of any kind of a doorway. How had he even got in here? Her eyes were drawn to a flicker of light that briefly flashed through the boarded up windows, giving her hope that they were by a road that, if she could manage to escape from these bonds, would be a great place to look for help.

Readjusting his cloak to instead hang down the right side of his body, The Spiraliser again stepped into her line of sight. Tilting his head slightly, a kind smile spreading across his face, he’d returned to the compassionate state that she’d first glimpsed.

“I know how that must have looked,” he soothed, lightly placing his hand on his chest. “I’m just exhausted. King Crocodile’s master plan has kicked into high gear recently and hasn’t left much time for sleep.” He let out a nervous laugh.

“We both reacted poorly to the situation,” he mumbled, looking directly at her feet and rubbing his hands together. “Can we start again?” Hesitating for only a brief moment, Cerise nodded with an accompanying, “Sure.”

The Spiraliser immediately perked up and met her gaze.

“Maybe it would help if I explained to you my origin story,” he gushed, taking a step towards Cerise. Taking a deep breath, he began. “When I was younger, I used to read all of these comic books. I saw all of these selfless and heroic men and women dedicating their lives to a cause that they never truly understood. It didn’t matter if they were baseline human or if they came from an alien planet; they fought to protect a world that both adored and feared them.”

Spiraliser squatted in front of her and rested a hand on her knee. It was cold; it was firm.

“I always wanted to be just like them,” he continued. “I was at home one night reading my new comics in my bedroom and heard my mum’s new boyfriend come home from work and began treating her in a way that just wasn’t okay; it wasn’t the first time either. I remember wanting to help her, but I didn’t think there was anything I could do. I wanted to be just like these people that I’d been reading about, but I didn’t have any of the powers.”

At this point in his soliloquy, The Spiraliser stood up straight, arms behind his back and began looking off into the distance. There was something familiar about the pose, but Cerise couldn’t quite place it.

“I don’t know what happened that night, but something snapped inside of me,” he boomed. “I told myself: never again.” Again, Cerise found herself starting to recognise parts of the story, but didn’t have a clear understanding of why. “It’s all kind of a blur from that point,” Spiraliser carried on. “What I do know is that I suddenly came to and I was standing panting in the doorway of my home, the guy lying on the ground looking up at me, a look of fear spread across his face. It was only later that my mum told me that I’d appeared out of nowhere, pulled him off her and thrown this piece of trash out of the front door.”

A proud smile spread across his face as he divulged his greatest secret; his voice lowered as though the room itself was bugged.

“What she didn’t know and what I worked out later is that my powers had activated that night.” he whispered. “How else can you explain what happened?” Tens of explanations jumped instantly into Cerise’s mind, but his proximity kept her silent. The Spiraliser stood up straight again and, raising his clenched fist in front of him, continued.

“Over the next few days, I began to experiment with what I was capable of,” he explained. “What I worked out is that I could twist my body to phase through the molecules in the walls as well as propel myself forwards by squatting and unfurling my body like a spring.

“I considered calling myself “The Fantastic Elastic Man”, but wanted something more unique. That’s why I chose my current name: The Spiraliser. I was wandering around in town, trying to process everything that I’d discovered about myself when the name spread into my head out of nowhere.” A look of awe spread across his face as he raised his fist into the air, then drew it close to his chest.

“From that point on, I knew what I needed to do.” He turned towards her as he concluded his soliloquy, a look of optimistic expectation on his face.

Throughout all of this, Cerise had found herself mentally pre-empting all of the important beats in his story: the unassuming childhood, the abusive family life, the unexpected burst of powers. It was all too uncomfortably familiar, but there was an uncertainty to her thought process that didn’t allow her to place exactly where it was all from.

It was a clichéd story, but that didn’t make it false. As The Spiraliser had been speaking, she’d been subtly wriggling her wrists, trying to work the ropes lose. They weren’t quite lose enough yet, but she had hope that, given enough time, she’d eventually get there.

All she needed was more time.

He looked at her expectantly.

“Do you understand everything now?” he asked.
