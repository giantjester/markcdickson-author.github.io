Although she currently had the upper hand, Dani knew that she had to play this carefully or she’d be needlessly antagonising the most powerful being in her universe. The night before, when she’d received a visitor in the night, she’d seen a way out from her current nightmare; a way to escape the enclosure that she’d been in for ten years now. A whispered message had woken her from her sleep in the dead of night, startling her into a reverent submission.

“When the cockeral crows thrice, he is come,” the female voice had intoned softly. “He will overcome the boundaries of your concealment and his being will wholly invade yours. Your entrapment will then be undone, the offspring that you two shall bear will rise up against your captors and slay them. You have but one chance to prevent this folly. Do you understand me, child?” Dani had laid there silently, knowing only how to nod in response.

“However,” the voice had continued. “I come to lead you down a divergent path. Take this weapon and use it to strike at the heart of your aggressor.”

Dani had felt all of the wind pushed out of her as two heavy metal objects fell on her from above. She'd quickly grabbed at them before they rolled onto the floor.

“After he makes himself known, one moment in time will be granted to you; that which bears the fruit of man shall provide the greatest rewards. Do not hesitate when he appears,” the mysterious Woman had breathed. “You will have but a single moment to strike at his heart. I will do what I can to guide you, but the burden will fall upon you to prove your worth.” There was a moment’s pause as if she'd considered her next words.

“He may speak soothing words of comfort but remember, he comes to envelop your very being.” Dani had nodded again in response. “If he is not deterred by this weapon, know that it will give control over your foe,” the voice had concluded, beginning to fade away.

As it spoke its last sentence, the comfort of her voice disappeared as quickly as it began: “You have the power.”

Dani had laid there, unmoving, trying fruitlessly to retain all of the information that she’d been given. The entire conversation had felt like her wishful thinking, a dream in which she’d finally be able to get free, that she had kept her hopes low as she fell back to sleep.

It was only when Dani had woken in the early light of the morning, bow and quiver still clutched tightly in her hands, that she'd finally allowed herself to believe that all of this was actually going to happen. As she began to examine the bow, she had tried to picture the person who had given it to her.

The bow that she’d been given was ornately carved with depictions of animals in various forms: a cow grazing on an open field, a female lion standing off against an unseen foe and a peacock standing tail spread, immensely proud of its plumage. As Dani had hefted an arrow in her hand, she was surprised by the surprising weight to it; although it felt exactly like the type of arrows that she’d been familiar with, it simultaneously felt somehow more substantial.

It was then that she’d noticed another addition to her room: a pristine statue of a man who looked strikingly familiar. Dani rolled out of bed and walked over to the bust, feet slamming roughly against the floor. She poked the statue with the arrow she was clutching in her hand and it moved with the force of her push, rocking slightly as she pulled the arrow away. Before she’d had time to examine the figurine further, Dani had heard the sounds of a cockerel crest the lip of her window, tolling the arrival of her unexpected guest.

At the first crow, Dani had frozen in place, eyes wide, unsure of what to do, where to hide. At the second, Dani threw herself onto the bed and began fiddling desperately with the bow, trying to work out where best to hide it. The third crow went out. Impulsively, she’d pulled the nearest red sheet and thrown herself backwards onto the bed - arms, legs and hair all haphazardly strewn. Her right arm had fallen off the bed, still holding the bow as tightly as possible. Now all she could do was wait.

It had been difficult to lie there so still while still clutching onto the bow, feigning sleep, knowing what was coming for her. She’d heard him come through the window. After a moment of nothing, she thought that maybe she’d misheard, but then came the grunt.

“After he makes himself known, one moment in time will be granted to you,” the disembodied voice echoed in her head. “Use it.”

Without thinking, Dani quickly sat up in bed, nocked an arrow in the bow and fired blindly in front of her, trusting in the goddess to guide her aim.

Moments later, she'd found herself face to face with the being who she'd always been taught to be afraid of; to bow down to and placate wherever possible. Every time that Dani had used the bow, she’d put the entirety of her fate in the hands of the giver of this gift. Drawing from an unknown power, she knew that each shot would strike true. It was only now that her destiny was fully under the power of her words, her own actions, did she begin to falter.

When she was younger, Dani had always been told by her mother to stop grandstanding and actually confront her problems. When she’d been cast down into this dungeon all those years ago, she’d played the fool, the petulant child, and been lead down here with a sneer and an over-the-shoudler comment. Although she’d cursed her father’s name deep into the night, there was no way that she was ever going to let him see how much he’d hurt her.

That was why she’d pushed down all of her fear beneath a thin veneer of bravado. She was staring directly into the eyes of the god of the gods and he was entirely under her command. What she said next would shape the rest of her path in life, so she needed to choose the words carefully.

“Can you get me some grapes?” Dani asked. “I’m blimmin’ starvin’.”
