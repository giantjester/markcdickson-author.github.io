This all starts just over six months ago: I’m in the middle of a dream about lifting into the air when my alarm goes off. Half an hour later, I’m ready for another day, at least outwardly.

In a very literal sense, I’m ready: suit on, tie fastened, lunch packed. I’ve clambered out of bed, trying not to disturb the boyfriend that I’ve left sleeping, telling myself that five hours sleep was enough sleep and all that I need to do to succeed is dedication and a commitment to carrying on. Just keep calm and carry on.

No. Shut up.

I’m on the train as always, still not quite got around to buying that monthly ticket, and it’s fine. Honestly, it’s fine. I know that it could be a lot worse, but when you’re actually in the moment and you feel like you haven’t done enough with your life yet and too much of your time is wasted away on things that you shouldn’t be doing, it doesn’t actually feel like it. I read on the train, I write on the train and I sleep on the train. Sometimes I even branch out and decide to watch TV on the train; those are the days that people around me talk about in reverent tones.

I crowd onto a shuttle bus after that, still far too small for the amount of people that get on each and every day, and watch the city go past me. It’s the same places, the same buildings, the same people that I see every day but I can’t say for sure that I could tell you anything about any of it. Maybe that just means that I’m unobservant; maybe it just means that I don’t care enough about it.

I sometimes talk to this woman on the bus.

“Tim,” she’ll say to me. “I don’t know how you do it. Another day, another dollar. Shoulder to the grindstone. Another day in the workhouse. I really wish they’d just add a few more days onto the weekend.” I politely chuckle. Some days she even adds some commentary that pulls me even deeper into conversation with her when she starts talking about her new holiday: “Monday fun-day”. That sticks with me; a shrewd observation that decodes another layer of the life that we all strive to understand.

I like my job most of the time, honestly. There are times, when I’m achieving something, that I start to think that this might be a job that I can do for the rest of my life.

“Tim,” my boss will say to me. “What’s the most that you can commit to? Have you got an absolute deadline that you can give me? No, that’s entirely wrong. Have you thought about plotting the data this way instead?” We have a laugh, we do. I always politely chuckle. After all, isn’t that just the funniest thing that you’ve ever heard?

So, a Monday morning not too long ago, I’m there at my desk and a new intern walks up to me and introduces himself. At least I think it’s a new intern; it also might be 'Bring Your Teenage Son To Work' day. Anyway, we shake hands and I sit down and start walking him through some of the information that he needs to know: health and safety briefings, what our department actually does, or at least what I currently think it does, along with who I am.

“Tim,” he says to me. “I’m looking forward to working with you.” We shake hands again as he leaves.

“Thanks little kid,” I say back. “I’m looking forward to working with you too.”

The week flies by, each individual day dragging out to its fullest, until finally it’s the weekend again. I arrange to spend time with my boyfriend, watching TV or maybe even going to see a film. We’re both at home when he looks at me.

“Tim,” my boyfriend says to me. “What do you want to eat for dinner? What do you want to do now? Is everything OK? I love you.” I hear him talking and I pause.

“What did you just say?” I ask him. He looks at me. We’re both standing there, making food in the kitchen and we’re both there just looking at each other.

“Tim,” he says. “I love you.” That’s not what I wanted to hear him say though and he knows it.

“No. Not that.” I say. “The thing before that.” He looks at me and I look at him.

“Tim,” he says. “Is everything OK?” I look at him and he looks at me. That’s when I come to the realisation: I’m not OK. I’ve been chugging along through my day to day life and it’s only standing there with my boyfriend that I realise how much everything else doesn’t matter to me.

“Tim,” he says again. “Is everything OK?”

So I spend the next few months going and speaking to someone about all of it. It’s not a major problem, but I sit down a couple of days and week and speak to this therapist that my doctor recommends.

“Tim,” my therapist says to me. “You’re sad. You’re depressed. You need to keep coming to me every day forever and you’ll keep coming to me for as long as you live.” I agree to all of this because I’m already starting to feel better. I’m in a bit of a haze but I’m starting to emerge from it. Mornings don’t hurt as much. I can think about spending a day at work without having to catch myself before I fall down.

A few months after that, I’m at work, having a chat with the teenager who’s been coming to me for quite a while now.

“Tim,” he says to me. “You look better. You look happier.” I feel better. I feel happier. Then the day wraps up as normal, but I decide to walk home to get a little bit of exercise. As I’m cutting through the high street, I get a phone call from my boyfriend.

“Tim,” he says to me over the phone. “I’m just heading into town. Do you want to meet for a cup of coffee?” I say yes; why wouldn’t I?

We agree on a place to meet, that Nero Coffee on the corner of The Fallow, so I start heading there. I’m on my way there through the park when I start to walk past this Helter Skelter. I’ve walked past it time after time on my way to work, but never really taken any note of it before now. I walk up to the guy guarding this thing and ask for a ticket.

“Tim,” he says to me. “Aren’t you a bit too old for something like this?” I don't know how he knows my name, but I wave him away, hand him the money, grab a sack and I head up the stairs. On the way up, I call my boyfriend and I tell him what I’m doing. He tells me that he doesn’t understand, but he’s on his way.

So I’m at the top, looking out over the city, when I hear my boyfriend shouting up to me.

“Tim,” he shouts at me. “What are you doing?”

I see the park beneath me and look at all of these people, living their lives without a care in the world. I decide to join them.

“Having fun,” I shout back. I push off from the top, sack in hand. I spin around and around, maniacally laughing, clutching onto this sack for dear life when I start to feel something happening. I start to lift off into the air, my momentum taking me even further into the sky. I let go of the sack as I continue to rise.

I hear the guy down beneath me ask my boyfriend what’s going on. I hear my boyfriend reply.

“Tim,” he says. “Tim flies when he’s having fun.”
