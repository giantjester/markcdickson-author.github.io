Dani gorged herself for hours. First, it was all kinds of fruit, which became biscuits, which eventually became cakes and culminated in an entire chicken. Her food for the past few years had been limited to what could fit through small limits of the skylight, which had subsequently relegated her to subsisting almost entirely on flatbreads. Throughout it all, Zeus glared down at her from his place on the wall, only able to leave the room at her will.

Dani was sitting on her brand new, luxurious chair and had just bitten from a succulent chicken leg when she looked up at Zeus. Pushing herself off the arm, she strutted over to him.

“So you know what I need to do now, right?” Dani said, struggling to speak through her full mouth. “I need to get me an heir.” A speck of chicken flew out of her mouth and landed on Zeus's humanoid form. He wiped it off with a free hand, eyes never leaving Dani’s face.

“What?” he spat. “What in all of Greece are you talking about?”

 “You,” Dani pointed the half-eaten chicken leg at him before continuing, "don’t know why I’m down here, do you? I thought you were this all-knowin’ bein’. You sure seem to have a lot of weaknesses.” She continued to gesture with the chicken leg as she spoke.

 “My precious dad, that right ol’ bollock up there,” she said, pointing upwards with her free hand. “He put me down here because he was told by one of you,” she jabbed the drumstick in his face, “told him that I ever had a child with anyone, that that kid, whatever they were, would rise up and stick him in his sorry little face.”

As she spoke the last few words, Dani saw the expression of Zeus’ face shift slightly: a coy smile shimmered and an eyebrow began to rise.

“W-well, I mean, i-if you’re asking,” Zeus stuttered. Dani turned away from him and scoffed. Whirling, she threw the semi-shredded bone and it smacked into his face with a satisfying clunk.

“You must be bloody messin’ with me,” Dani chuckled. “You must be out of your bloody mind.” She leaned her face in close to his. “I wouldn’t touch you if you promised me a holy...blimmin’...vengeful...wrath-god of a son.”

This close, Dani could see a glowing fire in Zeus's eye that, when she stopped talking, grew a little brighter. Although she didn’t know how she knew, Dani was starting to think that her control might not be permanent. She knew that she needed to get what she needed and try, if she could restrain herself, to not provoke Zeus too intensely. Dani took a step back from him and took a deep breath.

“You might not think so, but I’ve actually got me an 'usband back at home,” she began. “Well...” She paused. “I wouldn’t call him an ‘usband exactly, cause we were only sixteen when I got locked away in here you see, but that’s how I’ve been thinkin’ of him since I got here.”

Dani shook her head briefly to break her train of thought.

“Anyway,” she continued. “I need you to go and grab him and bring him down here. His name’s Dec - he runs a farm somewhere near Sephiros.” Dani paused for a second to think. “At least he used to,” she mumbled to herself. “Wow.” Regaining her composure, she shook her head again and looked up at Zeus. “Ask around for him. I’m sure that somebody will know where he is.”

Sighing, Zeus nodded. He waved his arms and disappeared with a small pop. Dani’s eyes suddenly opened wide.

“Actually Zeus,” she called out to the thin air. With another pop, Zeus reappeared in the same spot, eyes bleary but unwavering. “Grab some more wine too,” she commanded, gesturing at the empty jugs behind her. “It’ll help set the mood.” Another slow nod from him later and he was gone.

Alone in the room, Dani quickly sniffed her armpit and, deeming it acceptable, started roughing up her hair with her hands. Not one second later, Zeus reappeared, clutching the arm of confused and bedraggled man in one hand and two jugs of red wine in the other.

The man looked around the room in a frenzy, yelling obscenities, as Dani stared at him. Would he recognise her? Would he still love her? All of these questions were asked and answered within moments. His eyes finally found her face and, after a brief moment of squinting, his eyes opened wide. A beatific grin was immediately shared between them.

Dec ran towards her and they shared a rough embrace.

“It’s really you,” he blubbered into Dani’s shoulder. “I can’t believe it; it’s really you.” He pushed her away, but held her at arm’s length. “It is you, isn’t it?” he choked, tears streaming down his face.

“It’s me,” Dani chuckled, her throat catching as she spoke. Dec paused for a second, taking in her face and then immediately pulled her in again. They stood there for a moment in silence. “Dec,” Dani began to say. “I need to talk to you about something.” He didn’t move. “It’s actually pretty urgent,” she prompted.

“I looked for you for so long, I’m so sorry, but I tried to find you. I went to where he said that he’d keep you if he took you, but you’d already gone,” Dec began to say, barely stopping for breath. At this, Dani pushed Dec back, working herself free from his embrace.

“Dec,” she began again. “I love you for looking for me, but I have something that I need to tell you.” Dani placed one hand on either side of his face as she spoke. “You need to listen to me, OK?” she said, looking directly into his eyes. Dec nodded silently, his nose having joined his eyes at running down his face.

“We need to make a baby right now,” she demanded. Dec sniffed and wiped his nose, eyes narrowing. “I know, I know. It sounds crazy,” she said, waving her hands as she spoke. “But I need one if I’m ever going to get my castle back from my bloody holier-than-thou father up there.” He still stood there, staring at her blankly. Sighing deeply, Dani took her hands away from Dec’s face and took a step back.

“Alright,” she sighed. “I’ll give you the basics and then we need to get down to it.

“All that you need to know is that when I was fifteen, my father got told that if I ever had a child, that it would kill him. So instead of being a reasonable adult, he only went and blummin’ locked me down here, didn’t he? So, now that I have this guy here…” Dani nodded towards Zeus still hanging on the wall. His eyes were looking down and he was idly buffing his nails on his tunic, but it was clear that he was still paying rapt attention. “...I thought it best that we use him as much as we can.”

Dani took a step forwards and grabbed both of Dec’s hands, but kept her eyes firmly fixed on the floor.

“I thought that if we had a kid right now, and I know that this sounds crazy, but if we aged them up quickly, we could go and kill my father today.” She looked up at him to see him looking raptly down at her. Dani began to smile and then so did he.

“So, what do you think?” she asked, grinning. He leaned down and began kissing her, passionate from the offset. Although Dani was painfully aware of Zeus hanging on the wall, she couldn't help but wholly give herself to the moment.

“Fantastic,” she whispered as they broke apart. Dani put a hand on his chest and gently pushed Dec backwards. “But quickly, before we start, I need to do something.” They both turned towards Zeus to see him looking hungrily at the both of them. Dec grimaced as he recognised the intent of the gaze.

“Zeus is really bloody gross isn’t he?” Dec commented. Dani turned towards him and retorted, “You have no bloody idea”. She let go of her partner’s hand and walked up to Zeus.

“Please…” he moaned at her. “Please.”

Dani sighed yet again.

“OK then,” she said, rubbing her hands together. “You’re going to make sure that I get pregnant from whatever it is that we do here.” She turned to smile at Dec, something that he quickly returned. As Dani turned back to the god on the wall, she saw his eye twitch and the fire within it grow in intensity.

“Then when we’re done,” she resumed, noticeably speeding up her speech. “I want to be standing next to that child, fully grown, immediately. Alright?” Zeus’s eye twitched again, but he nodded.

“Good,” Dani nodded in response. She turned and walked back to Dec, hands outstretched, and they met in the middle with another kiss. Her arms around his neck and his wrapped around her waist. Parting a moment later, Dec looked down at her and raised an eyebrow.

“Do you think that we can still do...the thing?” he asked, grinning. Dani took a small step backwards and lightly hit him on the chest.

“How dare you; how do you think I’ve been occupying myself all these years?”

Dani spun quickly on the spot, stretching out her arms and sweeping Dec off his feet. He relaxed into her embrace and, as the spin ended, he leaned up and kissed her hard, full of the love and the passion that had been so long unclaimed. As they broke apart yet again, Dani began to walk towards the empty bed before glancing briefly over her shoulder. Zeus’s top half was hanging off the wall, his mouth agape, with such an intense quiver she couldn’t help but think of a little puppy.

Dani threw Dec lightly onto the bed and turned around to face her prisoner.

“Oh yeah. Don’t think we forgot about you Zeus,” Dani chided. “You’re not allowed to see or hear anything for the next 20 minutes.” Dec spoke up from the bed.

“Whoah, whoah, whoah,” Dec protested. “What do you take me for? Only 20 minutes?” Dani turned towards him and performed an exaggerated eye roll.

“Fine,” she agreed, turning back to Zeus. “25 minutes.” Dani turned and jumped spryly onto the bed.

Zeus found himself suddenly unable to see, to hear and, for the first time in his life, felt powerless.
