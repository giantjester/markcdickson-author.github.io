“Wait, wait, wait,” Zeus mumbled, wriggling his arms as he tried to defend himself with his hands. “Can’t we just talk first?” Even as the words left his mouth, he knew that they were a mistake. Dani stepped closer to him, pushing the point of the arrow into his face.

“Just talk, eh?” she hissed. “Just like you were gonna to talk to me?” Zeus found himself suddenly beginning to whimper; he hadn’t felt pain this absolute in so long that he’d become entirely unaccustomed how to deal with it.

“I don’t understand,” he mumbled. Dani took a step back, incredulous.

“You don’t understand?!” she shouted, punctuating each word with a thrust of her bow. “I don’t understand how I can be lyin’ here in bed one moment all happy and then a bloody goddess is starin’ down at me the next. She starts tellin’ me that you’re about to come in here and bloody rape me...” This roused Zeus back to his senses and he momentarily forgot the pain coursing through his body.

“Wait…did you say that somebody came to see you?” he enquired.

“Well yeah, that’s what I said,” Dani bit back. “I thought you were the all-powerful Zeus; you can’t hear a bloody human right in front of ya?!” With as self-reliant as he usually was, Zeus couldn't help but note that his mental faculties had been hindered somewhat since he had been struck with the arrow. He should have been able to immediately break free of these shackles, but instead he was stuck here debating with this member of the plebeian class.

“Alright look,” Zeus began. “We can make a deal here. You don’t need to shoot me again. I can help you. If you let me go then I’ll grant any wish that you want.” Dani chuckled to herself darkly.

“She said you’d say somethin’ like this,” Dani revealed, the grin plastered on her face. “She told me that if you did that,“ she paused briefly to adjust her aim slightly, “to shoot you right here.” Dani had lowered her aim from Zeus’ face to just below his waist, scrunching up one eye to help her aim.

“No, no, no, “ Zeus began to plead. “You don’t know what those arrows are doing to me and I might not be able to…” Dani lifted her face to meet his, reopening her closed eye, but keeping the knocked arrow firmly in place.

“You won't be able to...what, sorry?” she smirked. Zeus gritted his teeth and broke his gaze. “I’m sorry; I didn’t hear ya. You’re gonna have to speak up.” Dani shrugged and let go of the arrow.

The arrow pierced him, hitting the wall with a resounding thunk.

If Zeus thought that the previous shots had caused him pain, he quickly adjusted his definition considerably. A mental fire leapt from his pelvis and jolted immediately up to his head, span a cartwheel, then rebounded down into his legs. After momentarily kicking around between each of his toes, the bolt again fought gravity to ricochet around his chest. Even to Zeus, with all of his experience, an age passed before he was able to again form coherent thoughts.

Dani stood before him, the bow now lying at her feet. She toyed idly with an arrow in her left hand, twirling it absent minded between her fingers.

“Jeez dude,” Dani laughed. “That was intense to even watch. What did you do to this lady to get her so mad at you?” She paused for a second, answering her own question in her head.

“I’m guessing that this is some spurned lover, seeking revenge for something you did to her, ” Dani mused, beginning to pace from side to side, arrow still twirling through her fingers. “And I’m guessing that this isn’t the first time or she wouldn’t have done this much to you.” She paused momentarily. “But then I don’t know what you bloody gods get up to; you seem like you’re all petty enough to do something like this anyway.” Dani turned on the spot to face him.

“I’m guessing a wife, ” she queried, using the arrow to point at him. Zeus turned his head away, grumbling. “Okay,” Dani continued. “So it was your wife. So she’s pissed that you’ve done this before? Of course you’ve done this before; if you’re willing to do this once then there’s no way you haven’t done this before.”

“I haven’t, I swear,” Zeus burst out, feeling the after-effects from the arrows continue to spread throughout his system. “You can’t let one moment lost in passion, one single mistake, define me. You don’t even know me.” Dani whirled on him once more.

“You’re damn right I don’t know you,” she spat. “I don’t know you and you don’t know me; so what gave you the right to come waltzing in here and just bloody have your way with me?

“Just because you’re some almighty and powerful figure doesn’t mean that you get do what you want, when you want; there are bloody consequences. Now if you don’t give me one reason why I shouldn’t shoot you in the face right now, then I swear to, well, you, that I’m gonna do it.“

Dani walked over to her discarded bow, knocked the final arrow in it, and span to face the powerful overlord strung up on her wall.

“You’ve got ten seconds to convince me to save my last arrow.” She again closed her left eye, but, this time, pointed the shot directly into his face.

“I can get you out of here,” Zeus proffered, tripping over himself with his words. “Just say the word and I can carry you anywhere that you wish to go. Honestly. Anywhere.” Dani’s face fell for a second, but it gave Zeus all of the ammunition that he needed to continue. “I’ll take you out of this hole in the ground and then you’ll be able to live your life however you want; free from cares and free from whatever burden the Lord of this castle has placed upon you.”

Dani lowered the bow to her side and looked him directly in the eyes, eyebrows raised in disbelief. “You can do that..?” she murmured. “I’ve been here so long.” Zeus began nodding emphatically.

“Yes, yes. That’s easy for me,” he soothed, eyes widening. “All you need to do is free my arms and I’ll be able to do anything that you want. I’ll owe you one favour.” Dani took a small step towards him then caught herself.

“How do I know that I can trust ya?” she probed, turning her head to the side.

“You’ll still have the arrow in my…” Zeus began, involuntarily wincing as he remembered. “Just come over and pull them out of my hands and then you’ll get everything that you always dreamed of. I promise you; you’ll finally be free.” Dani stood there, staring blankly at him. “How long has it been?” he asked, a wan smile on his face. “Has it been months?” She shook her head mutely.

“Years,” she whispered.

“It’ll all be over as soon as you come and pull these arrows out of my arms,” he concluded. Dani waited for a moment, considering her options, then nodded. Her bow and remaining arrow dropped to the floor again, this time with a loud clatter.

Dani closed the gap between them and began eagerly pulling at the projectiles lodged in the wall. The first came out after only a few small tugs, but the second, the more recent of the two, was stuck fast. Zeus could feel the magic return to him, slowly but surely, but knew that he needed to wait until both arms were free.

“You’re making the right decision,” Zeus commiserated. “You’ve done really well to get me in this position.” She only nodded in response, focusing intently on pulling the final object lose. Moments later, Dani managed to get enough leverage on it that it came free.

The magic swirled into the room, flowing through him in wave after wave as the counterspell slowly drained from him. While there was still a noticeable dip in his powers from the magic that the remaining arrow was draining, he knew that it would only be a matter of time until enough power gathered and he could truly escape. Tracking down whoever put him here would be his second priority, but, first, he needed to deal with this pathetic woman in front of him. He decided to put on one final show for her before he struck her down.

Zeus began to chuckle, which turned into a laugh, which grew and grew into a near maniacal cackle. He drew more and more magic into himself, creating a visible maelstrom of energy in the room that began to tug at the tapestries on the wall.

“You made a grave mistake here, girl,” Zeus boomed. “Now you know to never cross one as powerful as me without bearing the brunt of the punishment.” The strength of the magical currents grew and grew, spiralling further and further into the air, finally tearing the bedsheets and the tapestries loose and combining in a terrifyingly beautiful sight.

“Do you fear me now?!” he thundered.

He looked directly at Dani standing before him and, instead of seeing her knelt into the ball that he was so familiar with, she stood staring him resolutely in the eye, nonplussed by what was unfolding in front of her.

“Do you not fear me?” he asked her directly, the menace slipping from his voice.

“Not really,” she responded, brushing her nails idly on her gown. “You should probably stop what you’re doing; it’s really messing up my room and you’re gonna have to tidy it up.”

Despite his efforts to maintain the cyclone’s growth, it began to slowly decline. The swirling tapestries fell silently to the floor in a bundle and the maelstrom became a small whirlpool, before finally dissipated into a calm stream. Confused, Zeus struck out his hands in front of him violently. Nothing happened. He tried again, staring at them intently. Nothing. He looked up from his hands at Dani, who had walked back towards her bow.

“Oh, didn’t I tell ya?” Dani mentioned over her shoulder. “Those powers also give me control over you. At least for now.” She bent over and slowly picked up the bow and the remaining arrow from the floor. Dani turned back towards him and began to grin.

“We’ve got a lot of work to do.”
