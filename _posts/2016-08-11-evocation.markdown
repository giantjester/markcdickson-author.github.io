I'm standing there in the middle of the pavement, staring up at this towering inferno of a building in front of me when it hits me: this building is never going to be finished. Scaffolding covers the entirety of the front side and there's a scattering of exposed brick from the second floor upwards.

Panning back down, I see the beginnings of a graffiti wall through the ground floor windows and start to worry that I'm unknowingly infringing upon some gang territory. Looking around me, I see nobody standing in the circles of street light, so I take a step closer to the window.

I peer through and see a scattering of bottles with half-peeling wrappers, weeds starting to peek through the half-laid paving stones and something that looks disturbingly like someone wrapped in a rubbish bag. This building was clearly abandoned a long time ago and has had some permanent residents inside of it for almost as long.

Am I really that unobservant? Recent events have told me that clearly I don't see as much as I claim to. No. If I don't think about it then it didn't happen. It can't have happened.

I take a step back and look again at the upper levels. I see the beginnings of some form of carved animal poking from the top of the roof. Now that I look at it, so much potential for beauty, for inspiration, contained within it, it's all I can do not to sit down and cry.

You always think that you have more time to finish it, a little bit more time to close that connection, but then something comes out of nowhere and snatches everything away from you. This warped, lifeless creature stares down at me, taunting me and I honestly don't know what to do now.

My legs start to ache, so I sit against on the cement and lean my back against the nearest flat surface, building climbing even further towards the sky. I find myself missing the abject judgement of the abhorrent shape and raise my gaze so that I'm again looking straight into its eyes. It knows what I've done and, even though it might judge me for it, it sticks around, forgiving but not entirely forgetting.

The door into the building used to be blue. Now it sits somewhere between the sky during a day that changed from sunny to overcast and something else poetic but pathetic. A simple knocker decorates the top half, but the surprisingly ornate letterbox stands out to me. Surrounded by a pristine, painted gold metal, it has those wiry prongs sticking out into the centre, pointlessly cleaning anything that passes through them. Receiving mail is something that all of us take for granted but is something that eventually none of us ever get to do again.

A man in a tall brown coat walks past me, chucking a dollar bill at my feet. Clearly I look even worse than I feel. Groaning to my feet, I shuffle forwards and lean through the pane-free window. The lump in the sleeping bag still hasn't moved.

“Hey,” I whisper. “Hey you. The guy in the bag. Do you want a dollar?” Nothing. As I start to lean further in, I get a better view of that graffiti on the wall.

*DOES IT STILL HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T SEE IT?*

I've seen scribblings on the wall in toilets and on the side of buildings before, but none of it ever stuck with me before that. I was looking at a combination of rubble, piles of trash and someone who may or may not be dead and I was about to lose it.

Everything that had happened in the past 24 hours had flown by in such a rush that I was now faced with a question of what I was going to do with all of this now dormant energy. Everything that was so absolutely unrealised and undeveloped was now going to exist in a state of perpetual limbo.

You get so used to behaving within a certain rhythm, within the confines that you lay out for your life, that when it's all torn apart you forget how to function as a human. It happens when you're younger and you immediately bounce right back, but it's different when it's someone that you helped to shape; someone that you loved more than you could ever think possible, far more than any partner.

That's when I realise that just because it was undeveloped, doesn't mean that it was all a waste of time. Just because you don't see the effects through to the end doesn't mean that it wasn't worth shaping with all of your heart. Effects still ripple through everybody that he met, spreading and growing exponentially, even now. This close up, I see the shoddy workmanship on the brickwork. I see the cracks in the inner walls. This building was never going to be finished.

I take a step back from the window and look up for the final time that night. I see that blob perched on top and I impulsively spit on the floor in front of me. There's nothing recognisable about this eyesore, this malformation. I can still do more.

No; wait.

*He* can still do more. Through me and through everyone that he met. I pocket the dollar begin, turn and begin to walk away. I know what I need to do next. I need to make sure that, no matter what I do, I do it for him.
