There was once a world full of majesty and wonder. Magic flowed as easily as the air and the people of the land depended on it as much as the water that they drank. There was a beautiful princess who every member of the kingdom adored with the entirety of their hearts; so breathtaking was she that each knew how quickly they would give their life for hers.

Unfortunately, this isn’t a story about her.

“My little toe is blistering in these shoes and I’m so unhappy.”

This is a story about a man named Edmund or, if you were so inclined as to agitate him, Ed.

Ed had a very particular way of talking. It wasn’t that he whined, it was that he was so consumed by an entitlement to the highest degree of comfort that anything to the contrary was an affront to his very being.

“Marguerite. MARGUERITE! Come help me!”

Cars and buses rushed past on their right, each eager in their own little way, and, as they began to approach the left turn onto the main high street, a fledgling market could be seen. It was one that pops up every year at about the same time; nobody truly knows the occasion, but people expect its annual appearance nonetheless.

The two of them were walking up a hill perpendicular to the main high street, Marguerite a few steps ahead when all of this went down. She turned to the shrill call of her name, nonplussed by the voracious call for attention.

Dressed to the nines in a supposedly fitted black tuxedo in the middle of the afternoon, Ed hobbled to a bollard on the side of the path nearest the road and leaned hard against it. The owner of the burger van that he was now partially blocking glared at him, but said nothing, as is the English way. Ed lifted his left foot into the air, presenting it to the woman now striding towards him.

“What’s wrong now, Mr Rainsworthy?” she enquired, dropping into a squat. Her loose fitting tan trousers bunched and she absent-mindedly adjusted her handbag strap to ensure it remained in place on the shoulder of her white, floral-spotted blouse.

“Weren’t you listening? God,” he huffed. He stuck his foot out even further. “My shoe is hurting my foot.”

She squinted as she reached out to grab his foot.

“What are you doing?” he asked, snapping his foot back.

“I can’t help you if you don’t let me look, Mr Rainsworthy,” she said, barely containing a sigh. “Give it here and I’ll see if there’s anything I can do.”

Ed moved his foot towards her, leaning far more heavily on the bollard as he did so. Marguerite took a hold of his foot and began to run her hands around its circumference, squeezing at regular intervals. Her eyes were somewhere off in the distance, mind processing.

“Are these your new shoes?” she asked, perplexed.

“Of course these are my new shoes,” he spat. “I couldn’t wear my old ones with a suit this nice. I had Jaspar run out and grab me a new pair.”

“What size did you tell Jaspar to get?” Marguerite inquired, letting go of his foot and pushing on her legs to stand up. At her full height, she was more than twice the height of Ed, stalwart and confident, which elevated her even higher again.

“Six. I’m a size six.”

Letting out a deep breath through her nose, Marguerite shuffled her bag to hang it from her forearm and began to fish through it.

“You know you’re not a size six anymore, Mr Rainsworthy,” she chided. Pulling her wallet out of her purse, she began to glance around at where they were. Marguerite knew this area reasoably well and was fully aware that all of these shops were far too well-priced for someone of Ed’s temprement; god forbid, the market.

“Where can we…?” she began.

Ed had been quietly stewing since his foot had been released. His tiny brain had been attempting to deal with this new development; a servant, his minder at that, had dared to tell him the undisputable fact of what shoe size he was.

“Excuse me?!” Ed screamed, lowering his extended leg to the floor. “W…what did you just say to me?” A passing cyclist turned his head towards the shrill sound of the shriek.

Marguerite snapped her head back towards Ed.

“Yes, Mr Rainsworthy?”

Ed was shaking with an uncontrolled anger.  He’d pushed himself slightly more upright and now only had the lightest touch on the bollard.

“Are you telling me my own shoe size?” he frothed. “Someone like you telling someone like me what my shoe size is?” He paused for dramatic effect.

“How dare you.”

Marguerite raised her hands placatingly.

“Mr Rainsworthy, I meant no offence. I only meant that with your recent growth spurt that you might…”

Ed raised a single finger, eyes widened and mouth set.

“Excuse me,” he seethed. “I wasn’t done.”

Chastened, Marguerite grimaced, nodded and lowered her hands down to her sides. Ed glowered at her, still panting from the adrenaline now coursing through him. Returning her purse to her bag, Marguerite adjusted her bag back onto her shoulder, smoothed her coat down and straightened up. She met his eye with characteristic firmness.

“When I tell you that I’m a size six, I’m a size six,” Ed said, emphasising each word. “Despite what you might think, I know my own feet better than you do. OK?” Marguerite nodded.

“It just means that these shoes are faulty, OK? I only bought them a couple of days ago so I couldn’t possibly have grown in that time. Does that make sense to you, or do you think I’m some kind of warped, super-growing monster?”

A small older woman walked past, wrapped in more layers than you would have thought were possible could fit on a single person. She caught the last line and smiled to herself. Ed paused, trying desperately to channel his father’s presence despite his current height.

“Well?” Ed prompted.

“Oh, sorry, sir. I was just trying to…” Marguerite stuttered. Stopping herself mid-sentence, she took the time for a long exhale.

“Of course not sir,” she said, voice back to its almost sing-song cadence. “Which of these shops do you want to go and buy some shoes from?”

The corner of Ed’s mouth began to twitch into a wry smile, all sense of outrage noticeably and immediately absent. Marguerite had learned to out-maneouvre most of Ed’s little games, but her inate compassion and her unwillingness to accept his true character kept tripping her up.

Gathering herself together, Marguerite shuffled her handbag further up onto her shoulder and took a step towards Ed, still leaning on his bollard-shaped crutch.

“Do you want me to take your shoes off?”

“And walk around on this dirty floor and ruin these socks? Who do you take me for?”

Marguerite ignored the question and walked over to stand next to Ed. She braced as she felt the traffic whiz just behind her, but knew that if she could just get Ed moving then the situation would eventually resolve itself. She slid her left arm underneath his right, wrapping around his back and grabbing the opposing shoulder. The manouevre left her in something of an awkward lean due to the difference in heights but, again, it was unavoidable.

“If you can just put your weight on me, then I can help you get to the nearest shop and we can think about buying you some new shoes.”

Ed made a loud noise of disgust and stuck out his tongue. Regardless, his hand let go of the bollard and he shifted his weight onto Marguerite.

“I don’t want to shop around here,” he announced, grimacing as he did so. “Everything around here is so cheap and tatty.” A few of the nearby market sellers turned and glared in his direction. Marguerite grasped his shoulder to pull him tighter towards her, trying to regain some of the balance that the awkward positioning had cost her. She braced again against the rush of the vehicles speeding past.

“Ow. You’re hurting me,” Ed whined. “Get off.”

“Mr Rainsworthy, if you could please…”

“I said GET OFF!”

“Edmund, be careful…”

“LET GO OF ME!”

And with that, he shoved her away from him, his free arm whacking her in the torso and his entire body weight shifting towards her. As was his way, he was blissfully unaware of the four-wheeler barrelling far too quickly up the road towards them.

Marguerite managed to catch her balance as she fell backwards off the pavement, arm reflexively sticking out behind her, legs a shoulder length apart. She existed in a pure state of shock for a moment, dazed by the heavy blow to her chest, wind knocked completely out of her. Marguerite was jolted into awareness by a loud horn blaring somewhere in scaringly close proximity to her. She turned towards it and gasped.

Coroners say that she was killed immediately on impact; the driver wasn’t speeding, but the speed limit was high enough to do some serious damage. Investigators were able to piece together exactly what had happened from the people on the street: the owner of the burger van, the cyclist, the old woman, the market vendors. It all helped to reduce the sentence for the driver of the vehicle.

Ed, minor and apparent trauma victim that was, was taken to the hospital and treated for shock from the incident before being quickly let go. He was picked up from the emergency room by his other minder, Jasper, presumably with the aim of bringing him back to his usual residence.

Unfortunately for the minder, tragedy was soon to strike again.

The car was found wrapped around a tree approximately two miles up the road from their house, both the minder and Ed pronounced dead at the scene. Following an investigation by both the coroner and scene forensics, it was determined to be a tragic accident due to Jasper’s age with his known dwindling vision. There was a noticeable absence of skid marks, ruling out an uncontrolled swerve and the toxicology report came back clean.

However, there was a rumour being passed around the manor house that they all lived in: Jasper was harbouring something of a deep affection for the child’s everyday companion. It was unreciprocated due to Marguerite’s engagement to another, but very apparent to anybody that ever glimpsed the two together.

Jaspar had always been vocal to other members of staff as to his disapproval of Marguerite’s treatments at Ed’s hands, but nothing real had ever come of it. He’d taken on double shifts whenever Marguerite would allow it, but mostly Jaspar had been a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.

There was an official funeral for both members of staff a week after their deaths; throngs of people arrived to say their goodbyes. Marguerite’s knitting circle from the next town over all came, bittersweet new black creations wrapped around them, and what remained of Jaspar’s family dropped by. All-in-all, given the manner of their congregation, a good time was had by all.

Ed’s funeral was a mandated part of the day for every person who attended to him at the house. His father stood silent and stoic, leaving as soon as the coffin began to descend, quickly followed by the rest of the attendees. It was a modest affair given the resources; the attendees talked about the event for a long while afterwards.

Despite also losing a bright spark of life, the world felt just that little bit full more of majesty and wonder. Magic might not flow as easily as the air, but the karmic balance is shifting that way.

There used to be a beautiful princess who everyone who had met her adored with the entirety of their hearts. The world might be a little bit darker without her presence, but she can rest assured that she was so breathtaking right down to her soul that someone would consider giving up their life for hers.
