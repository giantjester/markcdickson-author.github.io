“Go! Go! Go!”

As if rehearsed, they all darted out from their hiding places and ran. One by one, they reached the low wall and dropped to the floor, pressing themselves tightly against it. It had once been painted a bright green to match the rest of the complex, but the years of use and the intense weathering had stripped large chunks off. Lewis turned to look at his team beside him, tutting to see Martin curled up in a ball yet again.

“Are we all here?” he asked breathlessly. “Did we lose anybody?” He began counting them in his head before stopping.

“Where’s Chloe?”

Abbie and Mitch shared a glance.

“She tripped when we rounded the last hill and they trapped her,” Abbie mumbled, staring at the ground. “I’m really sorry. We didn’t think we had the time to…” Lewis raised a hand and Abbie immediately began to trail off. Sticking close to the wall, he crawled towards the pair of them and put a finger underneath her chin. Pushing it upwards, he met her gaze and held her in place.

“Don’t keep things from me,” he commanded. “The moment that we can’t trust each other is the moment that we lose this.” Despite his grip on her face, Abbie’s eyes fell defiantly to the floor.

“Do you understand me?” Lewis glared down at her. Abbie sighed and nodded meekly.

“Good,” he said, turning to face his crew. There were only five of them left standing. They’d begun the day as a group of ten, but their number had been gradually picked off in quick succession before he'd taken control. Lewis hadn’t minded; the weak only slowed him down. Chloe had begun to speak up a bit too often, so to see her fall so uneventfully, out of the real line of fire, brought him a strange satisfaction that he didn’t have any time to ponder.

“Give me a second to see where we stand,” Lewis said to the group at large. He shuffled back towards the wall and rose to his feet, remaining hunched over, before poking his head over the top. A large proportion of the black top was unadorned, but there were a few places that would make ideal cover. Their goal stared at him unblinkingly at the end of the runway. The way was clear.

“I can't see anyone,” he relayed.

The storage facility that they were running alongside towered over them in the sweltering heat, the corrugated metal reflecting the light to create an uncomfortable glare that bore down on them. That was where he needed to go. It gave him the cover that he needed, while it would also giving him a brief respite from the heat.

“I don’t want to do this anymore,” piped up George. “You’re making it too…” Lewis dropped back down behind the wall and turned to face George.

“Too what?” he spat. “Too safe? Am I winning a little bit too much for you, George?” Lewis hit him on the arm before continuing.

“If you think that hurts then just think about what these people are going to do to you? I may be pushing you, but that’s only because I know that you can do this.” Lewis paused for a second.

“Well not you specifically.”

George pouted his lips and pushed himself to his feet. Even at his full height, the top of his head barely crested the top of the wall.

“There’s a reason that nobody likes you,” George retorted. “I’d rather get captured than have to spend the rest of the afternoon with you. I’ll be back at camp waiting for you to die.” Turning on his heel with a flourish, George strode away from the wall and back in the direction from which they came.

“Coward,” Lewis mumbled, nonplussed, turning to the remainder of his comrades. “OK. So there aren’t many places for us to go now, but I know that we’re close. When I say go, run around the wall and stand behind the nearest thing that you see. We need to split up if we’re going to survive.” Abbie and Mitch both nodded silently. Lewis turned to the final member of the group. Throughout all of this, Martin had remained in his safety mushroom, seemingly oblivious to everything.

“Did you hear me, little guy?” Lewis asked.

“I...d...wan….” Martin mumbled.

Lewis took a step closer to him and nudged him gently with his foot. Receiving no response, Lewis squatted down beside him.

“Alright then, li’l fella.” Lewis said. “We’ll come back for you.” He patted Martin’s head before rising again to his feet.

“Move out!” he shouted.

The remaining three of them pushed off from the wall in turn, scattering as best they could. Lewis immediately ran towards the storage building, tugging open a door and darting inside. Out of the sun, he immediately felt a sense of relief, but knew that he needed to keep moving. The absolute blackness of the shed was making him feel cut off from the rest of his group and he had to make sure that they were staying in line. Cracking the door open, Lewis poked his head out tentatively.

A voice rang out across the tarmac.

“Lewis?! Lewis, where are you?” the voice called. “I can’t find her. Where did she go?” Lewis's eagle eyes darted across the expanse, trying desperately to pinpoint the source.

“Mitch? Can you hear me? Where are you?” Lewis called. He could see Mitch crouched behind a newly sprouting tree on the edge of the forest, desperately shoving himself against it, eyes darting around manically.

“Lewis?! Lewis, please,” Mitch cried.

Poking his head further around the door, Lewis now began hunting for Abbie. He couldn’t see a sign of her behind anything; he knew that she must have run deeper into the forest. He cursed under his breath and took a step back, letting the door shut gently. There couldn’t be much time left and he was running out of team members. If they were going to get through this, they’d need to make a move immediately.

A piercing scream and a fearful cry of “Abbie?!” ripped through the air. Cursing again, Lewis stuck his head back out of the door, eyes desperately scanning the treeline. Immediately, he saw Abbie’s spry form darting in between trees, panting desperately with wide eyes. She darted between tree trunks and crashed through their low-hanging branches, heading directly towards the tarmac.

“They’re here, oh my god, someone please help me.” she cried. “Mitch?! Someone please help me.” At this, Lewis saw her foot catch on a prominent root and she took a tumble, her sob tearing through the silence. Mitch let out a audible cry at this and began to cry silently from his hiding place. Lewis watched as Abbie’s pursuers reached her and consumed her, dragging her from where she fell and removing her from the game.

This was where Lewis saw his chance. The goal was so close that he could taste it. On the other side of this door, not more than twenty metres away, was the thing that could end all of this. He just needed a distraction and now he had the perfect ammunition. Shoving the door open with a loud clang, Lewis sprinted forwards, throwing himself into a skid as he reached the grass so that he slid alongside Mitch against the tree.

“You still have a chance to save her.” Lewis panted, lying coming as naturally to him as leadership. “She’s still there on the ground. You just need to go and pick her up.” Tears still rolling down his face, Mitch wiped his running nose with his hand, sniffed deeply and then nodded silently. Lewis glanced over his shoulder.

“I saw her. She’s on the other side of that tree. All we need to do is split up. You run that way,” he pointed, “and I’ll run back out onto the ground. Grab Abbie and we’ll meet up at the goal in two minutes.” Lewis didn't know what else to say other than a curt order.

“Don’t be late.” Lewis paused for a second and let that all sink in.

“You ready?” he asked. Mitch wiped his nose again and nodded.

“Go! Go! Go!”

The two pushed off from the tree, heading in opposing directions. Lewis ran as fast as he could, knowing that he only had seconds before they got him. As soon as Lewis heard his feet hit the tarmac, he heard a blood-curdling scream from the forest behind him. Apparently they’d been far closer than he’d ever imagined. No matter. He locked his eyes on the goal and pushed himself, harder than he’d ever pushed himself before.

Lewis vaulted over the see-saw and shoved past the tyre swing. He was so close to the end that the taste was palpable in his mouth. Ignoring the sound approaching behind him, he barrelled forwards. He was less than five metres away. He shoved onward. Three metres. He reached a hand out, feeling the energy of the goal reach out to him in response. Then he felt a pinch on his shoulder, signalling the end. He refused to accept it.

“You have to stop,” came a voice behind him. “I tagged you.” Lewis hesitated, pausing for a moment before continuing to run. He heard the voice rise in pitch and cry out again. “MISSSSSSS!” Lewis was so close; only a few more feet and he’d make it. The day that he’d been building up to for the past six months was finally here and he refused to let some no-good nobody take that away from him.

“Lewis Amersham,” a second voice came, with a weight that made him stop in his tracks. “Get back here. Immediately.” Lewis came to an abrupt stop and began glaring at the ground in front of him. “If you can’t do this fairly, then you don’t get to do it at all. I’ve already heard from Abbie that you might be taking this a bit too seriously.” Lewis scuffed his shoes along the floor, refusing to turn around. “Is that true, Lewis?” He mumbled something under his breath. “You’ve got to speak up, honey, or I can’t hear you.”

“I was about to win!” Lewis yelled, his voice catching in his throat. He paused before collapsing into a sitting position on the ground. “I was about to win.” He felt his teacher move around in front of him and lower herself into a squat. A yell of “MISSSSSS!” came from behind him.

“Give me one second, Grace, I just need to speak with Lewis for a second,” She rested a hand on his shoulder and tried to move her face into his view as she began to speak.

“Lewis, look at me,” she said, slowly. Tears began to form in the corner of Lewis’s eyes as he shook his head. “Come on, Lewis; it’s going to be alright. You’ll get a chance to try again next year and maybe you’ll reach the end then.” Lewis began to pick at the tarmac.

“MISSSSS!” came again from behind him.

“One second, Grace,” the teacher snapped, taking her hand off his shoulder and leaning back onto the balls of her feet. “You were so close to the end and you got closer than anybody else. You did so well.” Lewis sniffed, wiping his hand across his nose.

“I was about to win,” he mumbled.

“Come on inside, Lewis,” she offered. “The rest of your team is already there.” Standing up straight, she smoothed herself down and looked around the playground. “Actually,” she mused. “Have you seen Martin?” Lewis looked up from the floor and saw Grace standing there, tugging on the teacher’s sleeve.

“MISSSS,” Grace whined, pointing at the goal. “Martin’s over there. He won.”

Lewis eyes followed Grace’s gesture and saw Martin, smiling beatifically, standing with his hand on the wall. Long ago, the wall had had a bullseye target painted on it in red and, even though the paint had long since begun to peel, Martin had placed his hand firmly in the centre of it. Lewis began to cry once again, trying to drive an arrow through the target with the force of his gaze. He saw the teacher open her arms wide and begin walking away from him.

Martin continued to look around, beaming, his hand firmly pressed up against the wall. He saw Miss Kingsley walking over to him and smiled up at her.

“Did I win?” he asked tentatively. She squatted before him and nodded emphatically.

“You did. Well done, Martin. I'm very proud of you.”

Martin looked around at his classmates and took the moment in, worried that if he removed his hand then his victory would immediately dissipate.

“I won,” he repeated.
