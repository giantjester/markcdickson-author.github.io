The day that Juliet Burkin disappeared was the same day as the town’s annual general meeting. We gather together at the end of every year to catch everyone up on the comings and goings of the town and then, at the end of night, we all cast our votes to see who among us will lead the town into the next year's bright future. Rumours were being passed around like expired Halloween candy, but nobody knew the truth about where she'd gone.

Juliet was a beautiful woman by the standards of our town, but lacked the drive and the motivation to ever get drawn outside of it; she was someone who you knew had never so much as travelled beyond the town's boundaries. Although Juliet forced herself to keep fit by jogging around the centre of the town, she held herself in a way that deterred attention. No man had ever been seen knocking on her doorstep and that's the way she liked it; perfectly affable but never sought after.

Days had passed since the general meeting and nobody had seen neither hide nor hair of Juliet or her sister. For the latter, that indicated the worst. Juliet’s sister, Katie, had been sick for over a year, so to suddenly see nothing of either of them spoke volumes. A few local women gathered together a basket of local produce: jams, bread and the like; together, they knocked on the door of the Burkin family home.

It was a house on a street that, even its day, hadn’t been the pride of the town. It had been built during the town’s brief resurgence during the 1980s and had the brickwork of one house in many; it blended into the surrounding houses in the street, ironic considering its inhabitants. To everyone’s surprise, Katie answered the door, slightly bedraggled but otherwise looking well. She’d still been dressed in her pyjamas, the floral pattern of the tightly wound headscarf making her smooth, rounded head far more noticeable.

Her demeanor perked up as she saw the committee at her door and she accepted the basket with a polite, if cold, grace. Katie told the gathered women about how her sister had decided to head out on a business trip with her new associates although the manner of the research was not ascertained. Juliet had left her enough money to get by on for now, promising to send more in the future. When probed for more information, however, Katie hurriedly ended the conversation, shunning the women who had only wished her well.

It had all started months before when Jared had checked Juliet into a room at the town’s only hotel, despite the fact that her own house lay only ten minutes down the road. Jared carried himself as someone who had only been working there for a few days, despite the fact that he'd actually been there for years. His short, red hair clashed garishly with the deep purple of the hotel’s uniform and his emaciated physique left a lot to be desired.

Juliet had been there in a freshly ironed business suit, her long blonde hair flowing neatly over her high collared shirt. She’d been carrying a trimmed black briefcase and had looked nervous, but prepared, for whatever she was there to do. She was handed her room key but, after thanking Jared for his service, walked over to the waiting room in the foyer of the hotel. Jared had called over to her, questioning whether she needed anything else, but Juliet had insisted that that’s where she was meant to be. A man in a similarly pressed black suit had turned up not five minutes later and checked into the same room.

His eyes were the one thing that had stood out to Jared, even these months later. He’d described them as blue as a summer day, with eyelashes that hinted at extensive eyeliner. They were enticing in a way that exceeded normal human expectations. His face was dark but otherwise unexceptional. Jared had pointed him towards the waiting area, but was then called away by his manager to help another visitor with her bags.

When Jared finally returned to the front desk, Juliet had been lying in the man’s arms, resolutely unconscious. Her hair had lost its previously well coiffed form and was plastered to her sweaty forehead. Jared had inquired as to her well-being, but had been heartily dismissed by the gentleman. Instead of carrying her up to the room that they’d both checked into, the man began to carry her out of the front door.

This set off the alarm bells for the staff guarding the doors, as it would for anyone, but upon calling the police and checking the surveillance footage, it was deemed that Juliet had taken a liquid out of her own purse, downed it in one mouthful and then collapsed in the man’s arms. A short trip to the emergency room later, she’d been released under the uneven care of her sister. The man had been nowhere to be seen.

For the weeks after that, she’d looked disheveled and kept everybody at an even greater distance. When she shopped for her weekly groceries, she’d dismissed any inquiries as to the health of her or her sister. Gradually, she alienated the entire town, spending more and more time within her own home; she ventured out only for supplies from the local pharmacy and the bare necessities at the grocery shop. We all assumed the worst and sent our best wishes to Katie, but were always rebuffed. Some went to their house bearing gifts and well-wishes, but were always met with the firm action of Juliet closing the door in their faces.

The last time that anybody saw Juliet actively engaging in the affairs of the town was when she hired out one of the lecture halls in the local library. There’s a small college in town which, due to lack of funding, sublets their resources from the community. Juliet had lead a group of sharply dressed people, both men and women, into the lecture theatre, striding with a confidence unnatural to her character. Her hair was unkempt, strands of hair poking out from the side of lazy bun, but she’d looked more resolute than she had in weeks.

Juliet ran over her allotted time that day, so it was down to Mrs Humphries to dart in to get them to wrap it up. A group of disgruntled residents were beginning to gather outside. Mrs Humphries was a portly, uneducated woman, her weight highlighted by her short stature and her affinity for ill-fitting dress shirts. As she was nearing the age of retirement, her vision was deteriorating and what little knowledge she possessed was also fading; all she had now was her routine.

When Mrs Humphries entered the room, it was alive with debate. People from all sides were up and engaged, Juliet trying her best to placate the mass of questions. As Mrs Humphries sidled down the centre aisle, she overheard what she thought was a live discussion of jean pricing. As she couldn’t see why people would get so worked up about what she thought was an overused material, she dismissed it. Up at the front, Juliet stuttered out a profuse apology for going over, telling Mrs Humphries that all of this was about to lead to a life changing opportunity for her. Nonplussed, Mrs Humphries told her to wrap it up immediately; she had an array of angry students waiting outside.

Nothing came from that meeting as far as we could tell. Juliet continued to walk around the town for days after that, energy more depleted than ever. People started to grow more and more concerned about Juliet's ability to dedicate herself to the care of someone wholly dependent on her, so would continue to drop by with ready cooked meals. Unexpectedly, they were ungratefully turned away time and time again.

When it came to Juliet’s last day, she dropped into the local grocery shop to pick up an array of new tights and leggings. She mumbled something to the shopkeeper, Daniel, about heading out of town for a while, but wouldn’t elaborate on why.

Daniel was a habitual obsessive. He memorised people’s regular orders and found joy in getting things ready for people before they came in. Daniel had moved back into his mother’s house after his father had passed and his weight had subsequently returned to its high school plumpness. He knew what Juliet normally bought when she came into his store and this wasn’t it.

The way that she hung her head said volumes; this was something that she was being forced into and it wasn’t entirely above board. The sisters’ need to continue to pay for hospital treatments had finally forced her to make the ultimate compromise: to sell her body as an female escort. To think that this could happen to someone in our town was upsetting to a lot of people, but, quite frankly, they weren’t surprised about who it had happened to.

It wasn’t until weeks had passed since the general meeting that word began to spread about that fateful last trip to the store. The town continued to keep a close eye on Katie, bringing by the baskets that were now being graciously accepted into the home. Everything seemed well for a while. Eventually, however, Katie’s health began to take a turn for the worse. Nobody caught a glimpse of Juliet in town, at home or otherwise, so we carried on our nearly daily vigil until Katie sadly lost her life.

Coroners visited the house and took the body away, but were shaken by what they found inside. The room that Katie had been found in, her older sister’s study, unsettled them so severely that they refused to discuss it. We arranged as a town to have the memorial service inside the house to give Katie the send-off in the place that she loved the most. A handful of Katie's closest friends in town came, gathered around the edges of the plainly decorated living room and said a few kind words to send her off into the next life.

Juliet couldn’t be contacted and Katie herself had left no will, so Mrs Humphries designated herself as the head of the committee to clear out the house of the family's belongings. A large proportion of the house went by unregarded; most was either donated to the local charity or given directly to the more deserving. When Mrs Humphries finally pottered into the study, although she didn’t understand the true weight of what she’d seen, she knew that it was wrong. The police were called shortly after.

The room itself was almost pitch black. The curtains had been tightly drawn and an eerie red low-light cast jagged shadows across the room. All over the walls were developed photos of human limbs and various animals in varying states of dissection. Annotations were made in all kinds of markers, pointing out the parts of the human body that were most helpful or most resilient. The focus of her research appeared to be on the body’s own regenerative properties, but hastily scratched out drawings and the crumpled up paper in the overflowing waste bin pointed towards the futility of it.

As you walked around the room, you could see the progression of her research as she turned to alternate sources. More photos of decomposing rabbits, cats and other mammals had large red crosses over them; the only success appeared to be rooted within the common lizard. Everyone who entered the room was lead along the journey of sketches, photos and research papers, piecing together a whole that demonstrated nothing but a gradual descent into compulsiveness and obscenity.

All the while, the only connecting thread was a single repeated phrase. Over and over again it was found scribbled in the margins, mentioned off-hand in recordings; the main reason why all of this become such a driving force in Juliet's life.

“For Katie”
