“I’m sorry, what?”

“I said you’ve got to take one headphone out. If there’s an emergency announcement then there’s no way that you’ll hear anything over the PA.” She took the ticket, circled the date on it and then turned to the person beside him.

“Ticket please.”

She leaned over him and grabbed the ticket, her hair falling uncomfortably close to his face. Putting his newly minted train ticket in his wallet, he chuckled under his breath.

“I’m sorry, sir, but that’s your seat reservation. I need to see your actual ticket as well.”

He slid the wallet back into the pocket of his suit trousers and picked up his dangling headphone. Throughout the exchange, the music had been blaring into his left ear and he knew that it was about to get to a critical part of the song. The key changed and it was the emotional pinnacle of the musical. This was his favourite part.

He put the headphone back in his right ear as he saw her circle the date on the ticket. The music began to swell and he felt that telltale tingle begin to travel down his back; this was the earned crescendo at the end of the first act and he really needed it right now. He felt a tap on his shoulder and pulled his headphone out yet again.

“Excuse me, sir,” she preened down at him. “You need to keep one headphone out; you don’t know if we’re going to have an emergency or tell you about a delay. It’s important that you’re able to hear everything.” Sighing, he nodded and let the headphone fall.

“Sure,” he agreed. “If it’s that important to you.”

“It’s not important to me, sir; it’s company policy. We’re required by law to tell you to do it.”

With that she continued on down the aisle, grabbing and circling, grabbing and circling. He turned to watch her walk away. He thought how, if she were a few years younger, he might actually have asked for her number. Spotting a lack of attention to one’s appearance had become a skill of his and it was always the most important quality in a woman to him. If they didn’t care about their appearance then why should he?

Turning back around, he grabbed the dangling headphone and put it back in his ear. He’d missed his favourite line and knew that he’d have to start again from the very beginning. Pulling out his iPod, he ran his thumb anti-clockwise around the wheel to get to the top of the album and confirmed his choice. This time, he wouldn’t be interrupted by anything.

He felt the train begin to oscillate gently not half an hour later. The man next to him had left at the last stop and the penultimate song of the act was building up; he’d found himself beginning to lightly conduct with both hands. He saw someone approaching him in the periphery of his vision, before knocking him with their bag. It jostled him out of his reverie and he glared desperately at the back of their head before closing his eyes again. He took a deep breath in and then out again. The gentle rocking of the train began to increase almost rhythmically, very nearly coming in time with the music.

The song was drawing to an end when a larger woman carelessly strode into him, slapping the back of his head with her handbag. As he opened his eyes to throw her the disdain that she deserved, he saw that she was dragging her suitcase loosely behind her, causing it to ricochet off the seats as she moved past them. Her arm had been shoved into one sleeve of her coat, the remainder hanging loosely off her shoulder.

“Oi,” he yelled. “What do you think you’re playing at? I’m sat here.” The woman jumped slightly and turned around to glare at him. Her mouth moved frantically and she pointed in the direction that she was heading.

“I don’t really care where you’re going lady, I’m trying to sit here.”

Her handbag slipped down her shoulder as she began to gesticulate wildly. She took a step towards him and grabbed at his arm. He darted out of the way.

“Don’t you dare touch me.”

She grabbed at him again.

“Look, you stupid cow,” he spat. “I’m exactly where I want to be right now and you need to leave me alone before I call someone.” Shrugging and shaking her head, she did just that.

He returned to his music. The final song had just begun and the clean, crisp notes were twinkling through his ears. His mind flashed back to the night that he saw it live on stage. The sense of wonder that had coursed through his veins; the woman that had sat beside him. The swaying of the train retained its rhythm, sliding in perfectly alongside his song. The strings came in at the perfect moment and his arms began to swing emphatically. He slid himself into the role of the conductor that night and he saw the majesty of the orchestra spread out before him. This was exactly where he deserved to be.

At the end of the carriage, the woman dropped her bags to the floor in a heap and sighed deeply.

“Is everybody off?” the conductor asked. The woman looked behind her at the carriage and then back at the conductor.

“Sorry, yeah.” she responded, shaking her head as if to clear it. “All of the humans are off.” The conductor spoke a word into the phone and there was a loud clunk as the carriage detached. As the woman turned to look through the glass door, she saw the carriage begin to drift away from her.

Back in his seat, the man felt the oscillations swell alongside the music and the climax of the first act reached its apex. He rose to his feet and swung his arms around, fully enveloping himself in the music and experiencing every note as if it were his own heartbeat. The key shifted for the final time as the wheels of the carriage slipped off the track. As the actress hit her final note, the carriage flipped. Metal scraped against metal and he found himself thrown full-force into the window. The orchestra cut off and there was a moment of silence before the next track began.

The headphones dangled loosely through the shattered pane of glass, nobody there to experience the new beginning.
