<p class="text-center">
  Was there still time left?<br/>
  It was closer to him now<br/>
  He hadn’t made it<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
  He grabbed at the hatch<br/>
  Heavy breathing never stopping<br/>
  Numb fingers fumbled<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
Tearing through it all<br/>
Nothing could ever stop it<br/>
Grand futility<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
This room was better<br/>
Time for a new direction<br/>
It was the small things<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
Grabbing what matters<br/>
Picking a door at random<br/>
Keeping on trying<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
His head felt heavy<br/>
So many hadn’t made it<br/>
But there was still hope<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
It had seemed simple<br/>
Cast one spell them return home<br/>
It caught up with him<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
Doors broke behind him<br/>
Huge weights splinter everything<br/>
There was still a chance<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
Sharp lefts. Harsher rights.<br/>
Just needed an opening<br/>
If only this was<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
His knife felt heavy<br/>
The backpack was far too big<br/>
And then there was “it”<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
Nobody had known<br/>
He now knew it was the key<br/>
To getting through this<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
He missed his boyfriend<br/>
The life that they used to have<br/>
And all it could be<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
Pardon the mistakes<br/>
Tragedy begets rebirth<br/>
But not as desired<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
This here was the place<br/>
Wide space; a breath of fresh air<br/>
He would make his stand<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
Tears rolled down his face<br/>
But strength surged through his body<br/>
Life was all he had<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
He heard it arrive<br/>
It seemed far smaller up close<br/>
Maybe he had a chance<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
As it came, he dodged<br/>
A cascade of blows both ways<br/>
Neither rising up<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
It enveloped them<br/>
He couldn’t let it beat him<br/>
This was his story<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
After it was done<br/>
As one climbed into the light<br/>
Something else remained<br/>
</p>

<p class="text-center">
No-one quite knew what<br/>
It was neither, but was both<br/>
A new beginning<br/>
</p>
