<blockquote>Cut to the inside of a stereotypical local pub. You know the type: passed down through the generations, with maybe a little buyout here and there, but lauded for miles as a place for families to go. The bar staff greet you with a smile and although the decor has become a little degraded through the years, you’re comfortable there. Paintings that may or may not be prints hang on the wall; you’ve always too drunk to walk up to them and actually inspect them.<br/><br/>

There’s probably a house pet lurking around in the background or maybe even some of the local farm animals. Whatever the specifics, you’ve been to this bar before. If you’re finding yourself thinking that you’ve never even heard of a place like this, then you’re part of the problem.<br/><br/>

You’re one of the people who I’m here to talk about; one of the people who have doomed this form of society through observation from the sidelines. Granted, you’re not as bad as the people who directly caused this, but we’ll get to that. It’s important that you realise exactly what we’re fighting for here.<br/><br/>

Let me paint you a picture. </blockquote>

“WHO SPILT SHITTING HORSE SHIT ALL OVER THE FUCKING STABLE? THE STUPID FUCKING DOG IS EATING IT.”

<blockquote>I know that’s not the most savoury place to begin, if you’ll pardon the disgusting play on words there, but it’s important that you realise the consequences of what we’re trying to fight for. Real people. Occasionally crude people, but honest and loving people.<br/><br/>

If we don’t fight for the little guy, for people like this delightful character of a woman, which I do mean wholeheartedly, then why do we even need to carry on. This freedom of speech, this freedom of action, is everything that we deserve and is the very reason that both of us are here today. This pub, this family, had their death warrants signed and sealed the day that many of you, not all of you, decided to sit back and do nothing. This is the story of how they died.</blockquote>

Janri stood in the doorway glowering. It was the middle of the afternoon, around three o’clock, so the midday crowd had filtered out and the evening rush hadn’t yet begun. The only residents of the venue were those currently under duress. Unfortunately for them, they both immediately began babbling incessantly.

“IwasputtingoutthestrawlikeyousaidandI…”
“NoIwastherefirstandthenPancameinandhe…”

They both broke off mid-sentence and turned angrily to face the other.

“Ididn’tdoanythingMumitwasMastiphandIsawhim…”
“NOYOUDIDN’TMUMHE’SLYING”

Janri slammed the door behind her, silencing the two children immediately.

“I just poked my head over the fence into the back garden and what do I see?” she asked, voice seething with rage. “That little dog that you both promised to take care of is out there, sniffing around and eating anything he can get his grubby little paws on." There was another clang as her buckets slammed against the ground.

"Do you have anything to say for yourselves?" she prompted.

There was a calm firmness to her that both of them immediately recognised: there wasn't anything they could say to calm her down when she got like this. Chastised, they stood there and looked up at her.

“I don’t care who did it,” she enunciated. “But both of you need to go and fix it." She paused for dramatic effect. “OK?”

Wide-eyed and seemingly repentant, the tawny haired Pan nodded an affirmative; Mastiph wasn’t quite done.

“BUT MUM,” he wailed glaring at the floor, his messy blonde hair falling into his eyes as they started to glisten. “I REALLY DIDN’T DO IT AND I SAW PAN…” he began, a thump to the arm from his brother stopping him in the middle of a thought. At this, tears began to roll down his cheeks.

“PAN!” Janri exclaimed. “You don’t ever hit your little brother. What was that for?” She knelt down in front of Mastiph and began gently rubbing the arm where he was struck, trying desperately to get him to look her in the eye.

“Get out the back right now, Pan,” she ordered. Seemingly immune to her rage, Pan turned away from his mother and, ducking underneath the bar, disappeared into the kitchen. Rotating Mastiph’s head gently with her hands, she met his eyes.

“Are you alright?” she inquired softly. “Does it still hurt?” Mastiph broke his head free from her grip and nodded slowly.

“I’m fine,” he sniffed. “I can go help Pan.” Janri rose to her feet, eyes locked on her son.

“Alright then,” she soothed. “You need to tell me if he hits you again, OK?” Mastiph quickly nodded and then he too was gone.

Sighing, Jareen picked up the buckets of milk and then she too started to walk towards the bar. Their inn had been in their family for at least four generations, depending on how you counted, since her great-great-grandmother had recaptured it after a hostile takeover. It had fallen into a state of semi-disrepair in recent years; through-traffic had slowed ever since they’d opened up the main road that runs by Fisher’s Creek, but they were hardy folk; they were managing to squeeze by.

As Janri rounded the side of the bar and started to lift up part of the bar with her elbow so that she could get behind it, she heard a rustling coming from inside the kitchen.

“Aeo?” she called. “Is that you? Can you please come and help me?” Aeolin emerged through the door, wiping his muddy hands with a cloth. Seeing Janri with her hands full, he darted over and lifted up the divide in the work-surface so that she could easily fit through.

“Do you need me to take a…?” he began. “Nah. I’m good thanks,” she answered, squeezing past him into the kitchen. Rag still moving over his hands, he followed her in.

“Did I hear the boys fighting again?” Aeolin asked, returning to the vegetables that he’d been chopping. “Who’s fault was it this time?” Janri sighed as she put the buckets on top of one of the wooden tables.

“Pan seems to be bossing Mastiph around,” she maligned. “I’m really worried about the two of them; there’s a good chance they won’t get to actually be friends when they get older if Pan keeps on like this.” Aeolin put the knife down on the chopping board and walked over to her. He walked up and wrapped his arms around her from behind. He rested his chin on her shoulder. Despite her stress, she found herself relaxing into his arms, letting out a sigh.

“Everything’s going to be alright,” he soothed. “We’ll get through this like we get through everything else.” She tilted her head towards him and rested her head on his, sighing again.

“What we need to do is set more boundaries for Pan,” he continued. “It worked last time and it’ll work again this time. Pan has more fire in him than we gave him credit for.” Janri wriggled free of his embrace and turned around to face him.

“Maybe it’s time to get him enrolled in that young ambassador program?” she suggested. “Do you think we have the money for that at the moment?” He nodded.

“We can make that work,” he agreed, a smile spreading across his face.

Janri suddenly jumped, remembering.

“Wait, where’s Rosi?” she asked, trying to push her husband away.

“Hey, hey, hey,” he soothed. “She’s fine. She’s out the front.” Janri pushed harder and his grip around her reluctantly loosened.

“Aeo,” she cautioned, the firmness back in her voice. “It’s not safe out there at the moment. You need to keep a close eye on her.” Janri strode out of the kitchen and Aeolin heard her open the front door and begin to call through it.

Her voice cut through the silence of the house. “ROSI!” she called. “ROSI, COME BACK IN FOR DINNER.”

Aeolin had walked back over to his workstation and resumed chopping. Just as he grabbed a green bell pepper, he heard her come back in behind him.

“Jan…” he began. Raising an open palm into the air, she interrupted him before he could get any further.

“No, Aeo,” she chided. “You know what it’s like at the moment. It’s not the same as it was when you were a child or even the same as it was last month. You need to realise and accept that it's up to both of us to keep our kids safe. Now I have to go out and find our daughter before she gets herself into trouble.” As if in response to her parents’ fighting, Rosi came charging in past her mother with a gleeful scream.

“MUMMMMYYYYYYYYYY,” she wailed, staring up at her mother with a beatific grin plastered on her face. “I got you one of dese.” Rosi thrust out her hand, the remnants of a broken and crumpled flower sticking out of a closed fist. Softening, Janri squatted down in front of Rosi and put her hand out, palm facing up. Dropping the flower onto her mother's open hand, Rosi then froze, sensing the lingering tension in the room.

She tilted her head slightly.

“Why you sad Mummy?” Rosi asked. Janri picked up the flower between two fingers and brought it to her nose before she answered.

“It’s nothing,” she answered. “Now go run upstairs and wake up your grandmother for dinner.” Content with the response, Rosi barrelled out of the room.

As the trail of “GRANMAAAAAAAAAA” faded into the distance, Janri again turned to her husband, tucking the flower behind one ear.

“Look, I’m sorry,” she began. “All of the rumours and threats that we keep hearing about scare me.” Scraping the chopped peppers into the nearby bubbling pot, Aeolin put down the chopping board and turned to her.

“I know you didn’t mean it,” he responded. “I’m scared too.” He walked over to her and they linked hands. “But whatever happens, we’ll face it together as a family,” he continued. “Whatever happens to one of us, happens to all of us.” Janri smiled up at him and they basked in each other’s presence for a second.

They heard the bar doors thunder open as Mrs Leslie Hirral, their friendly competition from over the road, stormed in.

“Jan? Aeo?” she called, a flash of panic clear in her voice. Walking through the kitchen door hand in hand, they greeted her with a combined aura of confusion and fear. “You guys have got to come and look at this. Right now,” she commanded, immediately turning on her heel and leaving the pub.

Quickly glancing at each other, the two split up, Janri running out the back door and Aeolin darting towards the stairs. As he took the stairs two at a time, Aeolin found himself suddenly worrying that his wife would find his sons in time.

Janri barged through the back door and scanned their back garden. She found herself cursing their selection of hutches and stables. The sun had set in the time that she'd been inside; Janri couldn't help but begin to panic. Even though she knew that nothing could have truly gone wrong in such a short space of time, she couldn't prevent that innate parental fear that everything was about to fall apart from bubbling up.

“Pan?! Mastiph?!” she cried. “You need to come in right this second.” Overcome with a strange and sudden fear, she took a few cautious steps forwards and began peering around the corners of the buildings that she passed. “Mastiph? Pan?” she echoed. “I'm not joking. You need to come to me right now.” Flashes of everything that might have gone wrong flashed through her mind: a hutch collapsing, a sudden horse kick to the head.

Everything that could go wrong was going wrong in her mind. Then a scream cut through the night and she began to run.

The shriek rippled out again and again, allowing her to instantly hone in on its source. She couldn't help but wonder if she'd been too harsh with Pan earlier; what if his last memories were of her shouting at him? Rounding the final corner, thousands of potential thoughts running through her mind, she froze at what she saw.

In front of her, she saw a near perfect repetition of a scene that she'd seen not five minutes earlier. Pan stood with his fist raised in the air, which had stopped the moment at he saw his mother rounding the corner, and Mastiph cowered in front of him, tears streaming down his face and that shrill noise bursting forth from his lips.

The melodrama of the situation smacked her fully in the face and overwhelmed her and, even though she knew that it was a terrible idea, she started laughing. Laughing at herself, at her fear and at her reservations. Knowing that she didn't have time to compose herself, she grabbed each of her sons by the wrists and dragged them towards the front of the house, ignoring all of their protestations.

The entire family huddled there in the street with the rest of their neighbours. The hill that their village was perched on loomed over the larger capital below, giving them a tragically ideal view of the situation. Despite the duration of the antics in the back garden, Janri was surprised to come out and find that she hadn't missed anything.

They were all stood there watching a purple beam of light creep up towards the sky, radiating out a circle of light that illuminated the surrounding buildings for miles; a sight of simultaneous beauty and horror that they couldn't draw their eyes from.

It had apparently, according to Leslie, burst forth from the very centre of the city, accompanied by a booming, but strangely muffled, voice. There had been rumours abound regarding a meeting between embassies in the city at some point over the next few weeks, but nobody in the village had needed to travel to the city in over a month so all news was stale. Their farmlands provided adequate provisions and their social gatherings were legendary. They wanted for nothing; or so they thought.

The beam was reaching its apex and, as it did so, the end flattened before splitting into what appeared to be a rotating wheel. The spokes began to rotate, accelerating and accelerating until they again disappeared into the blur of a single object. All the while, it continued to rise towards the limitless sky.

Janri pulled her family close to her, again overcome by a sudden feeling of dread. Wrapping one arm around Mastiph standing in front of her and sliding her fingers into the hand of her partner standing to her right, she waited. They all waited. Suddenly, in a single moment, the sky wasn't so limitless anymore.

The beam appeared to strike an outer forcefield and the light then began to disperse across the invisible surface. Travelling further and faster with each encroaching second, it rushed across the sky towards them, blotting out the light from the stars as it went.

For some reason, although none of them could say how they knew, this cloud would be their end. Rosi, who was clutching onto Janri's leg, began to sob, unusually sensitive to the flavour of the atmosphere around her. Janri swore that she could hear someone begin to cry nearby.

All she could think about was time. Why was there never quite enough time? All of the futures that she'd planned for her children. Their plans to sell the pub and move to a cottage in the middle of nowhere. They could finally have bought a dog. There was so much that she'd wanted to achieve and had always thought that there would be more time. There should always be more time.

Then nothing happened.

The entire village stood there, rigid, waiting for the cloud to overwhelm them. Without warning, it entirely dissipated, vanishing into the night as quickly as it had apparently appeared. The stars and moon reappeared above them, illuminating the night in the familiar way that they always had. A few moments of tense silence ticked by. Then a few more.

A wave of relief flushed over everyone in the same instant. People were collapsing on the floor in each other's arms, unsure of what just happened, but ecstatic that it was over. Janri turned her head towards Aeolin and their eyes met. Sharing a wan smile between them, Janri squeezed his hand tightly before letting it go.

Picking up the still bawling Rosi, she turned around and began to walk back into the pub.

“Shhhh shhh shhhh,” she soothed, taking the flower from behind her ear. Tucking it behind Rosi's ear and pulling her daughter's hair forward to hold it in place, she turned to see her husband guiding their sons in the same direction, hunched over, with one small hand grasped firmly in each of his. Smiling, she turned and walked into the pub. Aeolin stood up to his full height and bellowed: “First drink on us! End of the world party!”

The crowd around him cheered and began to trail after him.

<blockquote>And for that moment, everything was alright.<br/><br/>

I said that this family’s fate had already been sealed. I didn’t say that it was all happening today. That spark in a distant land had rippling effects that, sure, would take their time to get there but, when they did, had effects that you, with your civilised and comfy lifestyle, could never truly imagine the consequences of.<br/><br/>

But we’ll get to that.</blockquote>
