Zeus gazed upon her resplendence with a visceral hunger that began in his chest and proliferated throughout his head and his heart. The God of Gods had heard of her beauty spoken of in distant lands, but there was no fair comparison to witnessing her being with your own two eyes. With her luscious hair falling across her shoulders and her supple body itself cast lithely across the bedspread, she was the epitomisation of the beauty that he’d come to desire above all else.

The castle of Lord Christopher Argus stood proudly, guarding its hidden treasure, but, from his great height, Zeus could see all. There was the tiniest of windows placed on top of the dungeon to allow in the tiniest slivers of light, but it appeared as though the woman was otherwise sealed inside.

How long she had been in there was the talk of local myth, but none could stand against his guile and his might. There were no imperfections in the firmness of the construction, that much was clear, a detail which Zeus ecstatically knew mirrored the beauty of the woman herself.

Zeus knew that he only had moments to act; the presence of his wife, Hera, could be felt on the borders of his consciousness but, precisely where, he could not say. He debated the manner of his appearance and which of his guises seemed most appropriate; if he did not appear proper, then she might not want him as wholly as he wanted her. Not one to dwell, Zeus decided to display his proud form in the way that most common folk believed him to exist in permanently; it was the purest form of all: light.

Zeus shimmered and, in a moment, he was gone. Rushing down through the cold morning air, he struck the skylight and, refracting ever so slightly, he turned and faced his newest conquest. In this close proximity, her rapture remained undiminished; Zeus knew that this union would create one of his most powerful offspring. Despite himself, he took a moment to take in what he was about to do, his form reverting to a more humanoid one impulsively, grunting slightly uncomfortably as he did so.

This room was tastefully, if plainly, decorated. Intricate yet immemorable tapestries adorned each of the four walls, with colourful, but near transparent sheets draped over each bit of furniture. The woman lay undisturbed in the centre of the bed, one arm tucked behind her head and the other hanging limply off the edge.

She had covered herself with a similarly light bedsheet of such a deep red that it made her pale skin seem unnaturally bright. Adjacent to him, Zeus noticed a flattering, if inaccurate, depiction of himself and, as he turned to admire it, the situation shifted.

He found himself struck by a blinding pain, the force throwing him back and pinning against the wall. The anguish began radiating from the point in his arm on which he was struck and overwhelming his head, his heart a moment later. A glistening gold arrow protruded from his almighty arm and his gaze darted incredulously around the tiny room. Sat up rigidly on the bed, the woman pulled another golden arrow from a quiver beside her and nocked it in an immaculately ornate golden bow.

“Awright then,” the woman said, rising slowly into a kneeling position. She had a firm, but soft, voice that rang very true to his sensibilities. “I thought the woman was off her head when she came in here mumblin’ and ramblin’ about a visit in the mornin’.” The woman shock her long hair out of her eyes and leaned closer towards the being hanging on her wall.

“Who are ya?” she prompted. Zeus found himself taken aback, speechless for the first time in millennia.

“Th-the god of all Gods, mighty though they may be, Zeus sits above all,” Zeus began, gesturing with his free arm as he continued. “He rules with a fair, but firm, fist. He… oof”. Another arrow struck his postulating arm, pinning it above him.

“I’m sorry, love. I had to, ” the woman apologised, pulling another arrow from the quiver beside her in the bed. Thinking for a moment, she chuckled. “I’m not all that sorry.”

She climbed slowly off the bed, careful to keep her bow trained on the being that she now had pinned to the wall.

“You come in here acting all hawty tawty with your beam of light and your transformations and you think that you can do whatever you want? You’re a bloody creep, ” the woman spat, taking a few steps towards him. “Ya know what I’m gonna do with you? I’m gonna teach you what happens when you mess with someone like me.” She stopped a few feet short of Zeus on the wall, bow unwavering.

“My name’s Dani by the way,” she added, moving the weapon to the side to look him in the eye. “Not that you cared to ask.”
