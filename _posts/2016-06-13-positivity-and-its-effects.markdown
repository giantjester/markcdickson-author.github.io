When someone passes, you hear lots of stories and facts about them that you never previously had a chance to hear. The kindest thing that I heard someone say about my maternal grandmother when she passed is that, when she knew that any of her family were about to do something important, she would carve out a moment at the time of the event and sit down and think positive thoughts about them. There was something about this sense of inherent and completely selfless sense of kindness that really spoke to me and I think part of me changed that day.

It's so easy to focus on you and yours that sometimes we forget to think about the thoughts and feelings of those around us. You might not mind that you haven't called home in quite some time, but I'm sure your parents do. Letting someone know that you're thinking of them at an important moment in their life is significant. It lets them know that they're not alone and that, if it does all turn out wrong, you'll be there for them. Kindness is something that goes a long way and it's easy to underestimate its importance.

Since then, I've tried to transfer this kindness over to all other aspects of my life. Surface level disagreements and immediate superficial judgements are easy to make and to maintain. However, at the end of the day, wouldn't you rather see all of the potential positivity of people and try to work to together to create something amazing? You don't know if that person over there is struggling with their weight. You don't know if that person over there has just gone through one of the worst days of their life. There's so much complexity and nuance in a person's behaviour that it's far nice and far more enriching to see the world as it could be.

I'm fully aware that there are people in this world who simply aren't nice; I'm optimistic but I'm not na√Øve. You can reduce yourself to their level or you can simply rise above it. It's an old adage, but it's an effective and apt one. This doesn't resolve itself in you thinking yourself better than them because you didn't insult them back; it's about moving on and realising that it doesn't actually matter. Stewing over the fact that this guy cut in front of you or criticised you at work might allow a certain level of gleeful self-indulgence, but it's not constructive.

I'm not sure what the point of this outpouring and oversharing was, but it's something that's been percolating around in my head for quite some time. A moment of kindness that seems so insignificant in passing can come around and affect you quite profoundly. My grandmother may no longer be with us, but she still affects me and changes me to this day. I smile whenever I drink some peach squash or when I get the chance to roll my 'r'. After all, isn't happiness all we can hope to be remembered for?
