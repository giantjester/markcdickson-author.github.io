Pineapples. Cerise couldn’t stop thinking about pineapples and that time that she’d bought a bunch of them for really cheap. Why had she ever thought that was a good idea? Nobody needs fifteen pineapples.

The world spun into existence around her as she slowly opened her eyes. Lifting her head from her chest, she felt the drool dripping down her chin. Had she fallen asleep at her desk at work again? Raising her hand to wipe it away, Cerise immediately realised how heavy her arms felt. Was she going to have to wait until the circulation returned to them before she could tidy herself up?

She needed this job; her rent was due next week. As her surroundings solidified, Cerise saw that she wasn’t in her office. This wasn’t anywhere that she’d been before. Stomach dropping, she realised that her arms weren’t dead; they were tied.

Slipping into a blind panic, she tried to look around her to decipher her location. The windows were boarded up from the inside and the last remnants of the day strained to slip through the gaps.

Eggshell paint peeled from the walls and there were holes where maybe a painting or a photo used to hang. To her chagrin, there wasn’t anything else in the room. There wasn’t a door or, as far as she could see, any sign of where a door used to be. She was trapped. She was alone.

Not content to sit alone and submit herself to her fate, Cerise began struggling against the bonds that kept her confined to her chair. What began as a gentle wriggle turned into a significant rock from side to side as she attempted to gather enough momentum to slip her hands free. The friction from the rope was burning her wrists, but she wasn’t going to be anybody’s damn damsel in distress; if she was getting out of here, she was doing it herself.

Unfortunately, as the momentum continued to grow, Cerise felt the balance of the chair tip and, just before her head hit the floor with a loud crack, she swore that she caught a glimpse of a pair of eyes peering in through a small gap in the window.

“Hi. How are you feeling?”

Cerise groggily opened her eyes and felt a throbbing on the side of her head. Someone had righted her on the chair but was just out of her sight. As her eyes drifted lazily up from the floor, the first thing that she caught glimpse of was his shoes; those luminescent, curly-toed yellow shoes stuck with you.

As she was attempting to work out exactly what it was that she was seeing, she felt a soft hand on the side of her head and impulsively recoiled.

“Hey, hey, hey…it’s just me,” a deep voice soothed. “What happened to you?” Cerise lifted her head and took in the large person kneeling right next to her.

His bulk was the first thing that you noticed; muscles rippling through absurdly tight lycra. A double helix blazened on his chest and she could see that the garish yellow of his boots wasn’t a coincidence: it highlighted the entirety of his otherwise bright blue outfit. A similarly yellow cape draped to the side of his body as he knelt next to her, concern radiating across his face. Despite her situation, or maybe due to the immense blow to the head, she couldn’t help but notice his high cheek bones and how traditionally attractive he was.

“Are you feeling OK?” he repeated, lightly touching the side of her face. “You must have hit the floor pretty hard.” Suddenly remembering exactly where she was, Cerise’s thoughts began to unravel.

“You’ve got to help me,” she sputtered. “Before whoever put me here comes back. My arms are tied behind me and you’ve got to get me out of here. Please.” Straining again against the bonds behind her, she was again forced to confront the fact that she was truly stuck fast.

The look of enthusiasm on this stranger’s face quickly turned into one of confusion and hurt. He paused for a moment before talking.

“But…I’m the one who put you there,” he replied. “Don’t you remember what happened?” Cerise stared back at him blankly.

“Why would you…?” she began, trailing off as she searched her memories for a semblance of memory. The last thing that she remembered was leaving work and turning down the side street besides the McDonald’s when something special had happened. She blinked as she attempted to put the pieces together. Had something fallen? Something sharp?

The cloaked man stood up to the full extent of his height and it was only then that Cerise realised how tall he actually was. The degree of his magnitude didn’t stop at his physical bulk, it extended to his stature. There wasn’t any way that she would ever be able to overpower him.

“You know who I am though, right?” the man questioned. As she shook her head, she recognised that it was the wrong decision. The man’s face hardened immediately. He resumed kneeling in front of her, but was somehow still towering over her. His presence had shifted so swiftly and so absolutely.

“How fucking ignorant do you have to be to have not heard of me,” he spat. He pointed at the logo on his chest and looked down at it as he spoke. “Look at it. Actually fucking look at it.” The words dripped from his mouth and Cerise found herself stunned by the sudden ferocity behind the words.

Receiving no response, his eyes raised to meet hers and she found herself retreating further into her chair. He raised his eyebrows and tilted his head to the side as he looked down at her, a wan smile creeping across his face.

“I’m the almighty fucking Spiraliser,” he enunciated. “And you owe me your precious little life.”
